"Define the specific endpoint(s) of the test system that you use for toxicity testing (e.g. cytotoxicity, cell migration, etc.). Indicate whether cytotoxicity is the primary endpoint. What are secondary/further endpoints? Also describe here potential reference/normalization endpoints (e.g. cytotoxicity, protein content, housekeeping gene expression) that are used for normalization of the primary endpoint.","Specific Endpoint: Migration inhibition Reference endpoint: Cell viability Note: Migration induction is also possible to assess, but complex in its toxicological interpretation. Therefore only unidirectional migration is assessed as an endpoint if the method is used in a standardized testing procedure in the prediction model.",Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by identifying migration inhibition as a specific endpoint and cell viability as a reference endpoint. However, it lacks clarity and completeness as it does not explicitly state whether cytotoxicity is the primary endpoint, nor does it mention any secondary endpoints or further reference/normalization endpoints beyond cell viability.","The specific endpoint of the assay is migration inhibition of human neural crest cells (NCCs). Cell migration is the primary endpoint used for toxicity testing in this system. Cell viability is measured as a secondary endpoint to assess cytotoxicity and is used for normalization purposes. The assay quantifies the number of migrated NCCs into the cell-free zone after exposure to potential toxicants, with migration inhibition being the main focus. Cell viability is also measured to ensure that observed migration effects are not solely due to cytotoxicity, and it serves as a reference or normalization endpoint to interpret migration data accurately (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf).",0.7786172728061955,0.1705653965473175,0.0301336105912923,0.0997917056083679
"Define and describe the principle(s) of the analytical methods used. Provide here a general overview of the method’s key steps (e.g. cells are fixed or not, homogenized sample or not, etc.), sufficient for reviewers/regulators to understand what was done, but not in all detail for direct repetition. If you have two or more endpoints (e.g. viability and neurite outgrowth), do you measure both in the same well, under same conditions in parallel, or independently of each other? For imaging endpoints: Explain in general how quantification algorithm or how semi-quantitative estimates are obtained and how many cells are imaged (roughly).","Migration inhibition: NCCs are plated around silicone stoppers in a culture dish and are allowed to migrate into the cell free area upon removal of the stopper. The number of migrated cells into the cell free zone is quantified 24 h after toxicant treatment. Migration inhibition of NCCs after treatment with toxicants is measured relative to control conditions (solvent control cells). For the quantification the cells are stained with calcein-AM and H-33342 for 30 min at 37 °C. The center of the well (migration zone) is imaged in four tiles with a 5x objective. Afterwards the four images are stitched together to obtain one image. For migration quantification, a software tool has been developed (http://invitrotox.uni-konstanz.de/). With the help of this software the previously cell-free area can be estimated and the number of H-33342 and calcein double-positive cells in the region of interest (ROI) can be counted. The diameter of the ROI was chosen so that 150 to 300 cells were in the ROI in untreated conditions. An Excel table containing the number of viable cells in the ROI of all wells of the plate is generated by the software. Cell viability: Cell viability is measured after 48 h outside the migration zone in the same well. The cells are stained with calcein-AM and H-33342 and four fields outside the migration zone are imaged with a 10x objective. Viability is defined as the number of H-33342 and calcein double-positive cells, viable cells are determined by an automated algorithm. An excel file is generated with the number of viable cells in each well. Migration and Viability are normalized to untreated controls.",High,"The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the analytical methods used, including the key steps involved in the migration inhibition and cell viability assays. It describes the plating and imaging process, the staining procedure, and the software used for quantification. The explanation includes how endpoints are measured, both in the same well and under different conditions, and details the imaging and quantification process. This level of detail is sufficient for reviewers to understand the methodology without being able to directly replicate it, which aligns well with the requirements of the question.","The assay employs high content imaging to assess two key endpoints: migration inhibition and cell viability, in human neural crest cells (NCCs). The process involves staining the cells with calcein-AM (for live cells) and Hoechst 33342 (for nuclei), followed by automated imaging. The cells are not fixed; live-cell dyes are used to enable real-time assessment of viability and migration behavior.

For the migration endpoint, NCCs are seeded around a silicone stopper in a well, allowed to adhere, and then the stopper is removed to create a cell-free zone. Cells migrate into this zone over 24 hours. After exposure to test compounds, the cells are stained with calcein-AM and Hoechst 33342, and images are acquired in four tiles per well using a high content imaging system. The quantification algorithm estimates the previously cell-free area and counts the number of double-positive (calcein and Hoechst) cells within a defined region of interest (ROI). Typically, 150–300 cells are imaged per ROI, and the software automatically counts viable cells based on fluorescence signals.

Cell viability is measured in the same wells, outside the migration zone, by imaging four fields per well with a 10x objective. The same fluorescent dyes are used, and automated algorithms determine the number of double-positive cells, representing viable nuclei. Both endpoints are measured under the same conditions and in parallel within the same well, allowing direct comparison of migration and viability data.

The quantification relies on automated image analysis software that estimates the number of viable cells based on fluorescence intensity and cell morphology, providing semi-quantitative counts. The software calculates the number of double-positive cells in the ROI, enabling objective and reproducible measurement of migration and viability.",0.8323899274357207,0.3053684830665588,0.2706019878387451,0.2906288802623749
