3.6 Differentiation towards the final test system,"Describe the principles of the selected differentiation protocol, including a scheme and graphical overview, indicating all phases, media, substrates, manipulation steps (medium change/re-plating, medium additives, etc.). Special/additional requirements apply to microphysiological systems and organoids: e.g. cell printing, self-aggregation/self-organisation process, interaction with the matrix, geometrical characterization (size/shape), etc.","Cells are frozen in liquid nitrogen and have to be cultivated in proliferation medium at 37°C and 5% CO2 after thawing. The medium contains Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium and Hams F12 (2:1) supplemented with 2% B27, 20 ng/mL EGF, 20 ng/mL recombinant human FGF, 1% penicillin and streptomycin. The thawing is performed by repeated addition and removal of proliferation medium to the vial until all cells are transferred to a tissue culture flask containing proliferation medium. The cells are carefully resuspended and distributed to 10 cm petri dishes filled with fresh, prewarmed proliferation medium. The cells are fed by replacing half the medium with new medium every two to three days (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). At each feeding day, the culture is checked for impurities (e.g. fibers or other debris). Impurities and the removed media are transferred to a new petri dish (waste dish). If spheres are mistakenly sorted out during feeding, they can be rescued and placed back in the original culture dish. After 3-4 weeks neurospheres reach the acceptable size of 0.2 – 0.5 mm for passaging by mechanical dissociation. Therefore, neurospheres are mechanically dissociated into pieces of 0.15 - 0.25 mm edge length (depending on the desired sphere size after passaging) using a tissue chopper, which then round-off again to uniform sized neurospheres within 1 day in proliferation medium. By using this method, neurospheres are expanded every week. Starting at week three poly-Hema-coated dishes are used for the cultivation procedure. Figure 8 differentiation towards the final test system. hNPC are thawed by repeated addition and removal of proliferation media. The resuspended cells are distributed to cell culture dishes and cultivated in proliferation media containing EGF and FGF for three to four weeks with 50% media exchange every two to three days. When the spheres reach a size of 0.2-0.5 mm they are expanded by mechanical passaging every 7 days.",Medium,"The differentiation protocol for the human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) in the NPC2-5 assay involves several key phases designed to model neurodevelopmental processes such as migration and differentiation into neurons and oligodendrocytes. The process begins with the expansion of cryopreserved neurospheres, followed by their transfer onto coated substrates to initiate differentiation.
 
 **Scheme and Phases:**
 
 1. **Cell Preparation and Expansion:**
  - Source hNPCs are expanded as neurospheres in proliferation medium containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and Ham’s F12 (2:1), supplemented with 2% B27, 20 ng/mL EGF, 20 ng/mL FGF, penicillin, and streptomycin.
  - Neurospheres reach a size of 0.2–0.5 mm after 3–4 weeks of expansion, with mechanical passaging every 7 days to maintain size and self-renewal.
 
 2. **Plating and Initiation of Differentiation:**
  - Neurospheres are mechanically dissociated into smaller pieces (~0.15–0.25 mm) and plated onto poly-D-lysine/laminin-coated 96-well plates.
  - Each sphere is placed in the middle of a well in differentiation medium (DMEM/Ham’s F12 with 1% N2 supplement, penicillin, and streptomycin) to promote migration and differentiation.
 
 3. **Differentiation and Migration Phase:**
  - Cells are cultured at 37°C, 5% CO₂, with medium changes every 2–3 days.
  - The differentiation period lasts up to 5 days, during which radial glia, neurons, and oligodendrocytes migrate out from the sphere core.
  - Medium is supplemented with specific factors depending on the endpoint (e.g., growth factors or inhibitors) to modulate differentiation pathways.
 
 4. **Manipulation Steps:**
  - Medium changes involve replacing half of the medium on day 3 to sustain differentiation conditions.
  - Mechanical passaging of neurospheres occurs weekly during expansion.
  - For the assay, spheres are plated at a size of 0.3 mm, and the process involves careful handling to prevent aggregation and ensure uniform size.
 
 **Substrates and Interaction:**
 - The substrate is a poly-D-lysine/laminin coating, which supports cell adhesion, migration, and interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM)-like environment.
 - The self-organization of neurospheres and their interaction with the matrix are critical, mimicking in vivo tissue architecture.
 
 **Special Requirements for Microphysiological Systems:**
 - The assay involves self-aggregation and self-organization of neurospheres, which produce ECM components and paracrine cues guiding migration and differentiation.
 - Precise control of sphere size and shape is essential for reproducibility.
 - The assay setup may include cell printing or microfabrication techniques to generate uniform spheres or organoid-like structures, although this is not explicitly detailed in the protocol.
 - Geometrical characterization (size, shape, and migration pattern) is performed via automated imaging and image analysis software, ensuring consistent assessment of migration distances and morphological features.
 
 In summary, the differentiation protocol is a multi-phase process involving initial expansion, mechanical dissociation, plating on ECM-coated substrates, and culture in differentiation medium with medium changes and manipulations to promote migration and differentiation. The self-organization and interaction with the matrix are fundamental, especially for modeling complex neurodevelopmental processes in a microphysiological context.","0,79","The answer provides a detailed description of the cell cultivation process, including media composition, temperature, CO2 conditions, and mechanical passaging. However, it lacks a graphical overview or scheme, and does not address special requirements for microphysiological systems and organoids, such as cell printing, self-aggregation, or interaction with the matrix.

6.1 Preparation/addition of test compounds,"Give an overview of the range of volumes, particular lab ware/instruments for dispensing, temperature/lighting considerations, particular media/buffers for dilution, decision rules for the solvent, tests of solubility as stocks and in culture medium, etc. How are compound stocks prepared (fold concentration, verification, storage, etc.)? How are dilutions prepared? What solvent is used? Is filtering used to obtain sterility? How does the final addition to the test system take place? Give details of addition of test compounds to test systems (e.g. in which compartment of compartmentalized cultures, in which volume, before after or during medium change, etc.).","The method is set up for 8 test conditions including 7 compound concentrations and one SC. The test conditions are prepared in a serial dilution from the stock solution (Figure 5). Stock solutions are prepared by diluting the compound in the solvent (e.g. DMSO) in a concentration that allows the preparation of the highest test concentration without exceeding the highest acceptable solvent concentration (see 0). For DMSO the highest acceptable solvent concentration is 0.1% which means that the stock concentration needs to be at least 1000x higher than the highest test concentration. Stock solutions in non-sterile solvents (e.g. water or PBS) have to be sterile filtrated using a sterile syringe filter (diameter 0.2 µm). Adsorption to the filter needs to be considered. Stock solutions are aliquoted and stored at -20°C. A stock solution is not thawed more than three times. For the preparation of the test condition the stock solution is diluted to the highest test concentration (default 1:1000) in differentiation medium. All following dilutions are prepared by serial dilutions of the highest concentration in differentiation medium containing solvent (in the concentration of the highest test concentration). The default serial dilution is 1:3 which covers a concentration range from e.g. 20 µM to 27 nM (729-fold). Depending on the desired concentration range, the dilution can be changed to 1:2, 1:5, 1:10 or other. The SC is prepared by adding the solvent to differentiation media in the same concentration as the highest test concentration. 100 µL of the compound dilutions and the SC are added to a 96-well plate (Figure 4). The serial dilution can also be prepared directly in the 96 well plates. hNPCs are added to each well after a 15 to 30 min equilibration period at 37°C and 5 % CO2. To subtract the background fluorescence of the phenol red-containing medium, 4 wells with medium only (Background, medium without cells, Figure 5) are prepared for the viability and cytotoxicity assays.Figure 5 Plating Scheme.

The cells are highly dependent on their mitochondria for ATP production, which allows a sensitive detection of mitochondrial toxicants. The UKN4 test method can be integrated into adverse outcome pathways as an important key event to predict potential adverse outcomes in humans.",High,"The test method (MitoMet assay, UKN4b) models the biological process of neurite outgrowth in human dopaminergic neurons derived from LUHMES cells, which reflects neuronal network development and connectivity (Source: Assay overview). It targets the central nervous system, specifically dopaminergic neurons, as the relevant tissue and organ. The assay assesses disturbances in neuronal development and direct neuronal damage, focusing on processes such as neurite extension, neuronal connectivity, and cell viability (Source: Assay overview).
 
 The biological processes modelled include neurite outgrowth, neuronal network formation, and cellular differentiation into mature dopaminergic neurons (Source: Assay overview). The assay also reflects mitochondrial function, as LUHMES cells are highly dependent on mitochondria for ATP production, making it sensitive to mitochondrial toxicants.

5.6 Positive controls,What chemicals/manipulations are used as positive controls? Describe the expected data on such controls (signal and its uncertainty)? How good are in vivo reference data on the positive controls? Are in vivo relevant threshold concentrations known?,Positive control: narciclasine (50 nM final concentration),Low,"The positive control used in the assay is narciclasine, which activates Rho and serves as a positive control for neurite growth inhibition (Source: EFSA Journal 2023:7794). The expected data for this positive control are a neurite area less than or equal to 75% of the DMSO control, indicating significant neurite growth inhibition, while cell viability should be maintained at 90% or higher of the DMSO control, reflecting that the effect is specific to neurite outgrowth rather than general cytotoxicity (Source: EFSA Journal 2023:7794). The variability of the positive control across multiple assay runs shows a mean neurite area reduction to about 40-75% of control with a positive control response variability (inter-experimental variation) of approximately 38.5%, indicating moderate to high consistency, but some inherent uncertainty exists (Source: EFSA Journal 2023:7794).
 
 Regarding in vivo reference data, the document states that the assay has not undergone formal validation and has not been part of a ring trial, implying limited or no established in vivo reference thresholds for the positive controls (Source: EFSA Journal 2023:7794).
