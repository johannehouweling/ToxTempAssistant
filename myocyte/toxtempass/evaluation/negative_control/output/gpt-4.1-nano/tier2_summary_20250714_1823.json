          "answer_text": "The assay utilizes human 3D microtissues derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and primary human hepatocytes, representing a human cellular model for toxicological assessment. The initial cell populations are characterized as follows:\n\n**Cell Source and Identity:**\n- **Cardiac Microtissues:** Derived from human iPSC lines from a single female donor (Caucasian, no known disease phenotype). The cardiomyocytes are differentiated from iPSCs using established protocols, co-cultured with fibroblasts from the same donor. The iPSC line is characterized by STR signature, karyotype analysis confirming normal chromosomal complement, and sex (female). Passage number at the start of differentiation is <20. The source is InSphero, with a specific batch number provided.\n- **Hepatic Microtissues:** Comprised of primary human hepatocytes pooled from 10 donors (5 males, 5 females, ages 7\u201359). These are obtained from a commercial supplier (InSphero), with documented donor information, and are characterized by their origin, purity (>90%), and viability (>85%). The hepatocytes are used at passage 1\u20132 post-isolation.\n\n**Biological Features and Functional Characterization:**\n- **Marker Expression:** \n  - *Cardiac microtissues:* Express cardiac-specific markers such as TNNT2 (cardiac troponin T), MYH6 (alpha-myosin heavy chain), and ACTC1 (cardiac actin). Confirmed via immunostaining and qPCR.\n  - *Hepatic microtissues:* Express hepatocyte markers including ALB (albumin), CYP3A4, and HNF4A. Verified by immunostaining and functional assays.\n- **Surface Antigens:** \n  - *Cardiac:* Positive for cardiac troponin T (TNNT2), \u03b1-actinin.\n  - *Hepatic:* Positive for ASGPR1, HNF4A.\n- **Functional Capacities:**\n  - *Metabolic activity:* Hepatic microtissues demonstrate active cytochrome P450 enzyme activity (e.g., CYP3A4 activity measured via luminescent assay).\n  - *Transport capacity:* Both tissue types exhibit relevant transporter expression (e.g., OCTs, OATPs in hepatocytes; ion channels in cardiomyocytes).\n- **Proliferation and Doubling Time:**\n  - *Cardiac microtissues:* Derived from terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes; proliferation is minimal (<1% Ki-67 positive).\n  - *Hepatic microtissues:* Hepatocytes show a doubling time of approximately 48\u201372 hours in culture.\n- **Genetic and Karyotype Stability:** \n  - *iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes:* Confirmed normal karyotype (G-banding), STR signature matches donor, no detectable transgene integration.\n  - *Primary hepatocytes:* No genetic manipulation; source verified by supplier.\n- **Purity and Composition:**\n  - *Cardiac:* >85% cardiomyocytes (TNNT2 positive), <10% fibroblasts.\n  - *Hepatic:* >90% hepatocytes, minimal non-parenchymal contamination.\n- **Additional Considerations:**\n  - *Source:* InSphero (supplier) for both microtissues.\n  - *Passage number:* iPSC-derived cells at passage <20; primary hepatocytes at passage 1\u20132.\n  - *Reproducibility:* Batch-to-batch consistency verified via marker expression and functional assays.\n\nThis comprehensive characterization ensures the cell populations are well-defined, reproducible, and suitable for toxicological testing, with established biological features confirming their identity and functional capacity."

Indicate the volume of the cells. Indicate volume (medium volume) and surface area of culture dish. Is there information/literature on IVIVE strategies/data in the test? Has the test been used earlier for IVIVE? Are there special considerations that are relevant for IVIVE (e.g. potential for compound accumulation due to frequent medium changes and compound re-addition, glycoprotein (MDR1) expression, capacity for xenobiotic metabolism of test system)?",
          "answer_text": "The parameters important for determining free compound concentrations in the medium include physicochemical properties such as logKow, Henry Law Constant, molecular diffusion volume, molar volume, and molecular weight, which influence partitioning, evaporation, and degradation (Source: application of the virtual cell based assay for simulation-KJNA28694ENN.pdf). \n\nThe lipid and protein content of the medium used in the test are 0.08 kg/m\u00b3 (lipid content) and 0.0234 mol/m\u00b3 (protein content), respectively, as specified in the experimental setup (Source: section 3.5.1). The cells have a defined volume per cell, with the cell volume for 3T3 BALB/c cells being approximately 1.73E-15 m\u00b3 for the G1 phase, with similar volumes for other phases (Source: section 3.5.1).\n\nThe medium volume per well in the culture dish is 1E-7 m\u00b3, and the surface area of the culture well is 3.31E-05 m\u00b2 (Source: section 3.5.1 and 3.5.2). \n\nRegarding IVIVE strategies, the document discusses the potential for in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE), including the use of physiologically based kinetic (PBK) models to translate in vitro concentrations to in vivo doses. The report notes that the VCBA model can be used to simulate chemical fate and bioavailability, which can inform IVIVE, although the current model does not explicitly incorporate metabolism or active transport processes (Source: sections 2 and 4.6). \n\nThe test system has been previously used in IVIVE contexts, notably in the ACuteTox project and other validation studies, where the model helped interpret in vitro toxicity data and compare it with in vivo toxicity endpoints (Source: section 4.4). \n\nSpecial considerations relevant for IVIVE include:\n- Potential compound accumulation due to frequent medium changes and re-addition, which can affect steady-state concentrations.\n- The expression of efflux transporters such as glycoprotein (MDR1), which can influence cellular uptake and efflux of compounds.\n- The capacity for xenobiotic metabolism, which is limited in the 3T3 BALB/c cell line used, as the cells are not metabolically competent, affecting the relevance of in vitro data for in vivo extrapolation (Source: section 4.6). \n\nThese factors should be considered when applying IVIVE strategies to interpret in vitro data and predict in vivo outcomes."
