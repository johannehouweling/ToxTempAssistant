1. **Quality Criteria for Proliferating Cell Line:**
   - The primary human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) must be obtained from the human cortex of gestational weeks 16-19.
   - The cells are provided as cryopreserved 3D neurospheres from a commercial supplier, Lonza, with a viability of at least 20% upon receipt.

2. **Specifications for Material:**
   - The hNPCs must express specific CNS neural stem cell and progenitor cell markers, including nestin, SRY-box 2 (SOX2), and Ki67, as confirmed by FACS analysis.
   - The cells should be free of pathogens, specifically tested negative for HIV, HBV, and HCV, and must pass sterility tests and mycoplasma contamination tests.

3. **Functional Parameters:**
   - The proliferative capacity of the hNPCs should be demonstrated by their ability to respond to growth factor stimuli (EGF and FGF) with increased proliferation.
   - The cells should differentiate into effector cells expressing markers of neurons (β-III-tubulin), astrocytes (GFAP), radial glia cells (nestin), and oligodendrocytes (O4) when cultured in the absence of growth factors.

4. **Control of Pluripotency:**
   - For iPSC maintenance, the control of pluripotency is not directly applicable to hNPCs as they are not iPSCs. However, the functional characteristics of hNPCs should be maintained through proper culture conditions and regular monitoring of marker expression.

5. **Stability Over Passages:**
   - The hNPCs should not be used for the NPC1 assay after passage 6 to ensure stability and functionality.
   - Variability in proliferative capacity may occur depending on the donor, but after the first mechanical dissociation, no observable inter-individual differences should be present.

6. **Quantitative Definitions for AC:**
   - Acceptance criteria include a cell count of 1.2 x 10^6 cells/mL, viability of at least 20%, and adherence of ≤50%.
   - The proliferative capacity is assessed by the size of neurospheres, which should reach an acceptable size of 0.2 – 0.5 mm for passaging.

7. **Exclusion Criteria:**
   - Cells that do not meet the viability threshold, show signs of contamination, or fail to express the required markers should be excluded from use in the assay.

These criteria ensure that the hNPCs used in the NPC1 assay are of high quality and suitable for assessing neurodevelopmental toxicity. _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_",0.7876011667326315,0.27106431126594543,-0.0371447317302227,0.10063333064317703

In the 3- to 4-week expansion period different donors can show differences in their proliferative capacity (spheres need longer, 3 instead of 4 weeks, to reach the acceptable minimum size of 0.2 – 0.5 µm). After the first mechanical dissociation, there are no observable or measurable inter-individual differences. Critical consumables The proliferation medium does not contain serum or serum replacement. The use of EGF and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is critical for sphere growth. FGF contains 1% bovine serum albumin and is thus prone to batch effects. Critical handling The thawing medium contains DMSO in a concentration that affects cell health which is why thawed cells should quickly be diluted in proliferation medium (30 mL of media for one vial of cells). It is recommended to add FGF to the proliferation medium directly before thawing. At the end of week two of the expansion period (see below), the spheres should be transferred to petri dishes coated with poly-(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly-Hema) to prevent cell attachment. Attached cells that are not differentiated can be gently detached using a 1000 µL pipet. To avoid repeated attachment, all cells should be transferred to a new poly-Hema coated petri dish. Medium containing FGF should not be stored longer than 1 week at 4°C. During the first two weeks, the medium should be removed using a 1000 µL pipet to keep the accidental removal of small spheres to a minimum. In addition, removed medium should be kept in a new petri dish under culture conditions until the next feeding day, to transfer accidentally removed spheres back to the culture. The neurospheres should be well distributed in the petri dish to prevent aggregation. This is especially important after mechanical dissociations. It is important to avoid frequent re-opening of the incubators, to ensure constant CO2 and temperature levels. Furthermore, the smallest vibrations can lead to aggregations of neurospheres.

At each feeding day, the culture is checked for impurities (e.g. fibers or other debris). Impurities and the removed media are transferred to a new petri dish (waste dish). If spheres are mistakenly sorted out during feeding, they can be rescued and placed back in the original culture dish. After 3-4 weeks, neurospheres reach the acceptable size of 0.2 – 0.5 mm for passaging by mechanical dissociation. Therefore, neurospheres are mechanically dissociated into pieces of 0.15 - 0.25 mm edge length (depending on the desired sphere size after passaging) using a tissue chopper, which then round-off again to uniform sized neurospheres within 1 day in proliferation medium. By using this method, neurospheres are expanded every week. Starting at week 2, poly-Hema coated dishes are used for the cultivation procedure.

These cells are cultivated as three-dimensional floating spheres, which allows them to represent key processes of brain development. 

### General Features/Principles of the Culture Protocol:
1. **Cell Source and Preparation**: The hNPCs are provided as cryopreserved 3D neurospheres from a commercial supplier, Lonza. Upon thawing, the cells are expanded in a proliferation medium that contains epidermal growth factor (EGF) and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) to promote growth. The medium does not contain serum or serum replacement, and FGF is critical for sphere growth.

2. **Cultivation Conditions**: The cells are cultivated at 37°C and 5% CO2. The spheres are passaged every week, and the culture is maintained in a medium that is replaced every two to three days. The spheres are transferred to poly-Hema coated dishes to prevent cell attachment.

3. **Differentiation**: The hNPCs can differentiate into various cell types (neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) when transferred to a different culture environment lacking growth factors. This differentiation is characterized by the expression of specific markers such as β-III-tubulin for neurons and GFAP for astrocytes.

### Contamination and Subpopulations:
- The acceptance criteria for the source cell population include being tested free of HIV, HBV, and HCV, and having a viability of at least 20%. Specific percentages of contaminating cells or subpopulations are not detailed in the provided context.
- The hNPCs are characterized by the expression of CNS neural stem cell and progenitor cell markers such as nestin and SOX2, indicating a relatively pure population of neural progenitor cells.

### Sensitivity to Cytotoxicity:
- The context does not specify whether certain subpopulations are more sensitive to cytotoxicity than others, nor does it provide information on differential cytotoxicity of specific chemicals or chemical classes for the cell sub-populations used in the assay.

Overall, the NPC1 assay is designed to assess the proliferation of hNPCs in response to test compounds, with a focus on understanding potential neurodevelopmental toxicity. However, specific details regarding contamination percentages, subpopulation sensitivity, and differential cytotoxicity are not provided in the available documents.

However, it lacks detail on other potential endpoints like gene expression or staining, does not specify acceptance criteria values, and omits historical control data and actions if criteria are not met. The methods for evaluating these criteria are also not fully described.","In the neural progenitor cell proliferation assay (NPC1), the acceptance criteria for the test system at the start of toxicity testing include several key parameters to ensure the quality of the primary human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) used. 

1. **Endpoints for Quality Control:**
   - The cells must display a perfectly round shape with no disintegrated borders.
   - A neurosphere with a diameter of 300 µm should contain approximately 2.6 x 10^3 cells.
   - The basic neurosphere culture is checked for mycoplasma contamination every three months and controlled for fungal and bacterial contamination by visual inspection at each feeding and plating day.

2. **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - The hNPCs must have a viability of at least 20% as provided by the supplier (Lonza).
   - The spheres should reach an acceptable size of 0.2 – 0.5 mm for passaging.
   - The proliferative capacity of hNPCs is assessed by their ability to increase in size by approximately 33% over three days in culture with growth factors (EGF and FGF).

3. **Analytical Methods:**
   - The evaluation of the culture includes visual inspection for morphology and size.
   - Mycoplasma contamination is assessed through specific tests.
   - The viability of the cells is measured using fluorescence assays that assess membrane integrity and mitochondrial activity.

4. **Historical Controls:**
   - Historical performance data for acceptance criteria parameters are not explicitly provided in the document. However, it is implied that the acceptance criteria are based on established benchmarks from previous experiments.

5. **Actions if Acceptance Criteria are Not Met:**
   - If the acceptance criteria are not met, such as if the viability is below 20% or if the spheres do not reach the required size, the cells should not be used in the assay. Further investigation into the cause of the failure should be conducted, and adjustments to the culture conditions or sourcing of new cells may be necessary.

These criteria ensure that the hNPCs used in the NPC1 assay are of sufficient quality to yield reliable and reproducible results in toxicity testing _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.",0.6284318463407681,0.6289195418357849,-0.008345271460711956,0.23989495635032654

The following parameters are important for assessing the cells:

1. **Neurosphere Shape and Size**: 
   - The neurospheres must display a perfectly round shape with no disintegrated borders.
   - A neurosphere with a diameter of 300 µm contains approximately 2.6 x 10^3 cells.

2. **Proliferative Capacity**: 
   - The proliferative capacity is assessed by the increase in sphere size. During the assay, hNPCs should increase in size by approximately 33% over three days in culture.

3. **Cell Viability**: 
   - The cells must have a viability of at least 20% upon receipt from the supplier (Lonza).

4. **Contamination Checks**: 
   - The basic neurosphere culture is checked for mycoplasma contamination every three months and visually inspected for fungal and bacterial contamination at each feeding and plating day.

5. **Growth Factor Response**: 
   - Proliferating hNPCs should respond to growth factor stimuli (EGF and FGF) with increased proliferation. The absence of these factors serves as a positive control, demonstrating the physiological functionality of the growth factor-dependent regulation of hNPC proliferation.

If the acceptance criteria are not met, actions may include:

- Discarding experiments where the neurosphere size does not meet the minimum acceptable size of 0.2 – 0.5 mm.
- Excluding data from experiments where the average increase in sphere size is below the expected 33%.
- Re-evaluating the source of cells if contamination is detected or if viability is below the acceptable threshold.

Historical controls and performance with regard to acceptance criteria are not explicitly detailed in the provided context. Therefore, specific averages and variations for acceptance criteria parameters from multiple differentiation attempts are not available.

It mentions sources of variation related to sphere selection and biological variability but fails to discuss critical consumables, batch effects, handling steps, controls, expected values, deviations, or recommendations for reproducibility and performance.","In the neural progenitor cell proliferation assay (NPC1), several factors contribute to variability in the final test system state:

### Known Causes of Variability
1. **Selection of Spheres**: The size of selected spheres can differ based on the researcher and the availability of spheres, which can vary between 0.25 – 0.35 mm _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.
2. **Biological Variability**: Primary human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) are a complex multicellular system with a self-organized sphere composition, leading to inherent biological variability in measured endpoints _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.
3. **Donor Differences**: Variability in proliferative capacity can occur depending on the donor, particularly during the 3- to 4-week expansion period _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.

### Critical Consumables and Batch Effects
- **Proliferation Medium**: The medium does not contain serum or serum replacement, and the use of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is critical for sphere growth. FGF contains 1% bovine serum albumin, which is prone to batch effects _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.
- **Cryopreserved hNPCs**: Spheres are provided as cryopreserved 3D neurospheres from a commercial supplier, which may introduce variability based on the batch of cells received _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.

### Critical Handling Steps
- **Thawing Cells**: Thawed cells should be quickly diluted in proliferation medium to minimize the impact of DMSO on cell health _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.
- **Medium Changes**: During the first two weeks, medium should be removed carefully to avoid accidental removal of small spheres _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.
- **Mechanical Dissociation**: Spheres should be mechanically dissociated to achieve uniform sizes, which can influence proliferation capability _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.

### Positive and Negative Controls
- **Positive Control for Proliferation**: Spheres are cultivated in the absence of growth factors (EGF and FGF), which should reduce proliferation to 0% of the solvent control (SC) for proliferation by area (NPC1a) and 0-40% of the SC for proliferation by BrdU (NPC1b) _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.
- **Negative Control**: The solvent control (SC) is used to assess if the acceptability criteria for NPC1 proliferation are met and for normalization of compound exposure _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.

### Accepted Deviations
- **Replicate Values**: At least three replicate values need to be present for each condition to be accepted for data analysis. At least five conditions and the solvent control must be present for concentration response modeling _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.

### Recommendations to Increase/Ensure Reproducibility and Performance
1. **Standardize Spheres**: Use spheres of uniform size (0.3 mm) for all assays to minimize variability _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.
2. **Automate Pipetting**: Utilize a liquid handling system to reduce variability and user bias in pipetting steps _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.
3. **Regular Quality Control**: Implement regular checks for mycoplasma contamination and visual inspections for impurities _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.
4. **Training**: Ensure operators undergo a thorough training period to handle the test system and understand image analysis and data evaluation _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.
5. **Batch Consistency**: Use the same batch of critical consumables (e.g., EGF, FGF) across experiments to minimize batch effects _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.

Moreover, they express the cell type-specific CNS neural stem and progenitor cell markers nestin and SOX2 (Koch et al., 2022). EGFR signaling is indispensable for proper brain development in vivo and increasingly expressed over time (Romano and Bucci, 2020). In line with that, exposure of proliferating hNPCs to the EGFR inhibitor PD153035 impaired the proliferative capacity (Koch et al., 2022).",Medium,"The answer provides detailed information about the features of hNPCs and their relevance to in vivo tissue, but it does not explicitly address where the test system differs from the mimicked human tissue or the specific gaps of analogy that need to be considered. The focus is more on the similarities rather than the differences or gaps.","The test system, which utilizes primary human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) from the fetal human cortex, reflects certain aspects of in vivo tissue, particularly in terms of fetal NPC proliferation during the fetal phase of prenatal development. However, there are notable differences and gaps in analogy that need to be considered:

1. **Complexity of In Vivo Environment**: The hNPCs represent a mix of neural progenitor cell types found in the fetal human cortex, but they do not fully replicate the complex interactions and microenvironment present in vivo, such as the influence of surrounding glial cells, extracellular matrix components, and vascularization.

2. **Developmental Stages**: The assay focuses on proliferation during a specific developmental window (gestation weeks 16-19). It may not capture the full spectrum of neurodevelopmental processes that occur before and after this period, such as neuronal differentiation, migration, and synaptogenesis.

3. **Lack of Other Neurodevelopmental Endpoints**: The assay does not assess several critical neurodevelopmental processes, including:
   - Neural Crest Cell (NCC) Migration
   - NPC apoptosis
   - Neuronal migration
   - Oligodendrocyte migration
   - Neuronal differentiation
   - Oligodendrocyte differentiation
   - Neuronal morphology
   - Synaptogenesis
   - Neuronal network formation

4. **Absence of Systemic Factors**: The assay does not account for systemic factors that may influence neurodevelopment, such as hormonal signals, immune responses, and the overall physiological state of the organism.

5. **Limited Metabolic Capacity**: The metabolic pathways of the hNPCs under proliferating and differentiating conditions are not fully characterized, which may limit the understanding of how these cells respond to various chemical exposures compared to in vivo conditions.

The inclusion of specific details about the experimental setup and endpoint assessment provides a comprehensive response.","The specific endpoints of the Neural Progenitor Cell Proliferation Assay (NPC1) used for toxicity testing include:

1. **Primary Endpoints:**
   - **Proliferation by area (NPC1a):** This is assessed as the slope of the increase in sphere size (amount of pixels in the bright-field image) over 72 hours.
   - **Proliferation by BrdU incorporation (NPC1b):** This is assessed as BrdU incorporation (an indirect measure of DNA synthesis) over the last 16 hours of compound exposure.

2. **Secondary Endpoints:**
   - **Cytotoxicity (72 hours):** This is assessed as membrane integrity by measuring the amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leaked from cells with damaged plasma membranes.
   - **Viability (72 hours):** This is assessed as mitochondrial activity by measuring the amount of resazurin reduced to fluorescent resorufin.

Cytotoxicity is not the primary endpoint; it is considered a secondary endpoint in this assay.

**Normalization Endpoints:**
- The solvent control (SC) is used for normalization of the primary endpoints. The SC is established to assess if the acceptability criteria for NPC1 proliferation are met and for normalization of the compound exposure and the positive control response. 

These endpoints are generated from the same experimental run and from each well/sphere in the 96-well plate, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of the effects of test compounds on neural progenitor cell proliferation and viability. _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_",0.8378213349691018,0.3023861050605774,0.09244775027036667,0.19201456010341644

Additionally, it does not explain the quantification algorithm for imaging endpoints or the number of cells imaged.","The analytical methods used in the Neural Progenitor Cell Proliferation Assay (NPC1) involve several key steps to assess the proliferation, viability, and cytotoxicity of human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs). The following is a general overview of the method's key steps:

1. **Cell Preparation**: Primary human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) are thawed and cultured in proliferation medium containing epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) for 3-4 weeks until they reach the appropriate size for the assay (0.2-0.5 mm).

2. **Plating**: The hNPCs are plated as 3D neurospheres in poly-Hema coated 96-well U-bottom plates. One neurosphere (approximately 0.25-0.35 mm in diameter) is placed in the center of each well.

3. **Exposure to Test Compounds**: The cells are exposed to increasing concentrations of test compounds in proliferation medium for a period of 72 hours. During this time, the medium is not renewed.

4. **Endpoint Assessment**: 
   - **Proliferation by Area (NPC1a)**: The size of the neurospheres is measured using brightfield microscopy at multiple time points (0 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h). The increase in sphere size is quantified as the slope of the area increase over the exposure period.
   - **Proliferation by BrdU Incorporation (NPC1b)**: BrdU is incorporated during the last 16 hours of the exposure period as an indirect measure of DNA synthesis. The luminescence signal from BrdU incorporation is measured using a multi-plate reader.

5. **Cytotoxicity and Viability Assessment**: 
   - **Cytotoxicity**: Membrane integrity is assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage from damaged cells. This is quantified as fluorescence of the reaction product resorufin in the supernatant.
   - **Viability**: Mitochondrial activity is assessed by measuring the reduction of resazurin to fluorescent resorufin in the last two hours of the exposure period.

Both endpoints (proliferation and cytotoxicity/viability) are measured independently in the same wells, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the effects of test compounds on hNPCs.

For imaging endpoints, the quantification algorithm involves automated image analysis using high-content imaging systems. The size of the neurospheres is determined from brightfield images, and the number of cells imaged can vary, but typically, multiple images are taken per well to ensure statistical relevance. The exact number of cells imaged is not specified, but the analysis aims to capture a representative sample of the neurospheres in each well to ensure accurate quantification of the endpoints. 

Overall, the NPC1 assay provides a robust framework for assessing the impact of chemical agents on neural progenitor cell proliferation and viability, reflecting key processes in neurodevelopment. _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_",0.775024844435339,0.3924667239189148,0.12104056030511856,0.24595262110233307

- DPBS: 2% v/v
- ddH2O: 2% v/v
- MeOH: 0.1% v/v

The rationale for using these solvents is that they must not produce effects by themselves in the test system. The expected data from these negative controls should show no significant effect on the endpoints measured, indicating that any observed effects in the experimental conditions can be attributed to the test compounds rather than background noise from the solvent.

The concentration setting for negative controls is determined based on the highest acceptable solvent concentration that does not interfere with the test system. This ensures that the solvent does not contribute to the observed effects, allowing for a clearer interpretation of the results from the test compounds.

Yes, unspecific controls are used in the NPC1 assay.

The test conditions are prepared in a serial dilution from the stock solution (Figure 4). Stock solutions are prepared by diluting the compound in the solvent (e.g. DMSO) in a concentration that allows the preparation of the highest test concentration without exceeding the highest acceptable solvent concentration (see 0). For DMSO the highest acceptable solvent concentration is 0.3% which means that the stock concentration needs to be at least 1000x higher than the highest test concentration. Stock solutions in non-sterile solvents (e.g. water or PBS) have to be sterile filtrated using a sterile syringe filter (diameter = 0.2 µm). Adsorption to the filter needs to be considered. Stock solutions are aliquoted and stored at -20°C. A stock solution is not thawed more than three times. For the preparation of the test condition, the stock solution is diluted to the highest test concentration (default 1:1000) in proliferation medium. All following dilutions are prepared by serial dilution of the highest concentration in proliferation medium with solvent (in the concentration of the highest test concentration). The default serial dilution is 1:3 which covers a concentration range from e.g. 20 µM to 27 nM (729-fold). Depending on the desired concentration range, the dilution can be adjusted to 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, or other. The SC is prepared by adding the solvent to proliferation medium in the same concentration as the highest test concentration. 100 µL of the compound dilutions and the SC are added to each well of a 96 well plate (Figure 4). Alternatively, the serial dilution can be prepared directly in the 96 well plates. One hNPC sphere is added to each well after the medium equilibrated for 15 to 30 min at 37°C and 5% CO2.

"How are data normally handled to obtain the overall test result (e.g. concentration response fitting using model X, determination of EC50 by method Y, use of EC50 as final data)? How do you model your concentration response curve (e.g. LL.4 parameter fit) and which software do you use (e.g. GraphPad Prism, R, etc.)?

Can you give uncertainty for non-cytotoxicity or no-effect? How do you handle non-monotonic curve shapes or other curve features that are hard to describe with the usual mathematical fit model?","The data is normalized to the SC and re-normalized to the starting point of the curve. For the normalization to the SC the median of each replicate data point is normalized to the median of the SC in the respective experiment. For the cytotoxicity assays the following normalization is used instead of the normalization to the SC. Here again each response value is normalized using the median of the lysis control and the median of the solvent control. lysis control − response normalized response = lysis control − solvent control The R package drc is used to calculate the optimal fit for each experiment. For calculations of curve fits and BMCs, the data from independent experiments is pooled (median of all replicate values for one concentration). Several non-linear models are run with the concentration response data of each endpoint and the Akaike´s information criteria is used to determine the best fit. For re-normalization of the data, the response value of the curves starting point is determined and used to re-normalize all response values. Therefore, each mean response value is divided by the starting point of the curve and multiplied with 100. For the re-normalized response values the curve fitting is repeated to produce the final concentration response curve. For deriving a reference point (RP) or point of departure (Pod) the Benchmark Concentration (BMC) approach as recommended by the EFSA Scientific Committee (Hardy et al., 2017) is applied. The BMC approach makes use of all data points that define the fitted concentration response curve. Thereby, the BMC is defined as the concentration that is associated with a specific change in response, the Benchmark Response (BMR). The BMR is a value of effect size and should be defined as an effect size that is higher than the general variability of the measured endpoint. The BMR is therefore determined based on the variability of the respective endpoint. BMR for NPC1: proliferation by area BMR30 proliferation by BrdU BMR30 cytotoxicity 72 h BMR10 viability 72 h BMR30 Based on the BMR and the concentration response curve, the evaluation tool calculates the BMC, as well as upper and lower confidence limits (BMCU and BMCL respectively) based on the predict function in the R package drc. The predict function calculates the prediction bands around the concentration response curve based on the deviation between independent experiments and gives an estimation of the area that is expected to enclose 95% of future data points. The BMCL is thereby defined as the intersection of the lower band and the BMR while the BMCU is defined as the intersection of the upper band and the BMR.

1. **Scientific Rationale**: The NPC1 assay links test method data to relevant in vivo adverse outcomes by modeling the proliferation of hNPCs, which is a critical process during brain development. Disruption of this process can lead to cognitive dysfunction and other neurodevelopmental issues. The assay reflects key neurodevelopmental processes that are essential for proper brain formation and function, thereby providing insights into potential adverse outcomes in humans.

2. **Toxicological Target**: The primary toxicological target of the NPC1 assay is the developing brain, specifically focusing on the proliferation of neural progenitor cells derived from the human cortex during gestation weeks 16-19.

3. **Biological Processes Modeled**: The assay models the biological process of fetal neural progenitor cell proliferation. It reflects the growth and expansion of hNPCs, which is crucial for brain development.

4. **Toxicological Events Modeled**: The NPC1 assay reflects toxicological events such as adverse effects on cell proliferation. It also assesses general cell viability and cytotoxicity, which are important for understanding the overall health of the cells in response to test compounds.

5. **Human Adverse Outcomes**: The assay is related to human adverse outcomes such as cognitive dysfunction, which can arise from impaired neural progenitor cell proliferation during critical periods of brain development.

6. **Hazards Predicted**: The NPC1 assay potentially predicts hazards related to adverse effects on cell proliferation, which can indicate the potential for developmental neurotoxicity in humans. It is designed to identify compounds that may interfere with the normal proliferation of neural progenitor cells, thereby posing a risk to neurodevelopment. 

This comprehensive approach allows for the assessment of chemical agents that may pose risks to human neurodevelopment, thereby aiding in hazard identification and regulatory decision-making _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.",0.7488869683186201,0.17907573282718658,0.052505940198898315,0.11600001901388168

What is a ‘hit’ if the test is used in screening mode (= hit definition, if different from above)?","Two prediction models (PM) are applied for the NPC1 assay. One PM for a downregulation (PM downregulation) and one PM for an upregulation (PM upregulation) in cell proliferation. PM downregulation The PM uses hit definition based on comparison of the confidence intervals (CI) for the BMC of the DNT- specific endpoint (BMCs) and the unspecific endpoint (cytotoxicity/viability; BMCus). Thereby the following four hit classifications apply: “no hit” “specific hit”: “borderline hit”: “unspecific hit” The compound is not defined as a hit. The compound is defined as hit and the CI’s do not overlap, meaning that the upper confidence limit of the specific endpoint (BMCUs) is lower than the lower confidence limit of the unspecific endpoint (BMCLus). The compound is defined as hit and the CI of the specific endpoint overlaps by less than, or equal to 10% with the CI of the unspecific endpoint. The compound is defined as hit and the CI of the specific endpoint overlaps by more than 10% with the CI of the unspecific endpoint. The compound is classified as a hit, if the concentration response curve generates a BMC and if the CI is within the test range. In case the CI spans above the test range, the compound is only classified as a hit, if the highest test concentration is significantly different from the lowest test concentration. The adjusted significance (p<0.05) is thereby determined using a Tukey HSD test. The decision process for the prediction model is described in the flow chart in Figure 5. Figure 5: Decision tree for the PM for down regulation applied for the test method NPC1. Overview of the decisions leading to the classification of a compound in one of four categories: “no hit”, “specific hit”, “borderline hit” and “unspecific hit”. Specific consideration for the prediction model: In case no confidence limits are available for the unspecific endpoint because the BMR is not reached, the BMCLus is assumed to be the highest tested concentration. If the CI of the specific endpoint additional spans above the test range for a compound identified as “hit” based on statistical significance, expert judgement is applied to define if the “hit” is specific or unspecific. Therefore, all datapoints of the unspecific and specific endpoint of the highest test concentration are compared. If these data points do not overlap, the compound is classified as “specific hit” otherwise as “unspecific hit”. In general, BMCs based on the same BMR are compared (e.g. BMC30us vs BMC30s). In case the BMC30us is not available for an endpoint that allows the generation of a BMC10us, the BMC10us is used instead. If the classification of this comparison is “unspecific hit”, the compound will be flagged as “check manually“ as the BMC10us is lower than the BMC30us leading to a higher probability of a false classification. To avoid such false classifications, expert judgment is needed. Compounds can also be flagged as “check manually”, if the classification, based on the viability is different from the classification based on the cytotoxicity and if the confidence interval is very wide (BMCU/BMCL > 25), which means a high uncertainty for the BMC estimation. In both cases expert judgment is needed to decide on the classification. The expert judgement is an individual decision process that accounts for effect size, curve progression, statistical significance and overall standard deviation. If the concentration response curves do not give enough information for decision by expert judgement, additional testing or testing in a different concentration range should be performed. PM upregulation In contrast to the PM for downregulation, the PM for upregulation is based on a hit definition without the comparison of confidence intervals (CI) between the specific and unspecific endpoint. The reason is, that specific and unspecific endpoints do not have the same relationship during an induction, compared to a reduction in the endpoint. A loss in general cell health will likely result in an effect on cell proliferation, while an induction in cell health (measured as mitochondrial activity) does not necessarily increase cell proliferation. The following three hit classifications apply: “no hit” The compound is not defined as hit. “specific hit”: The compound is defined as hit and the effect is no artifact due to loss in cell health. The compound is defined as hit in only the unspecific endpoints. “unspecific hit” The compound is classified as hit, if the concentration response curve generates a BMC and if the CI is within the test range. In case the CI spans above the test range, the compound is only classified as hit, if the highest test concentration is significantly different from the lowest test concentration. The adjusted significance (p<0.05) is thereby determined using a Tukey HSD test. The decision process for the prediction model is described in the flow chart in Figure 6. Figure 6: Decision tree for the PM for upregulation applied for the test method NPC1. Overview of the decisions leading to the classification of a compound in one of three categories: “no hit”, “specific hit”, and “unspecific hit”. In case a compound is classified as hit together with a reduction in an unspecific endpoint, it needs to be clarified if the induction is a specific effect or an artifact, due to a loss in cell viability or an increase in cytotoxicity. Therefore, expert judgement is applied, which accounts for effect size, curve progression, statistical significance, overall standard deviation but also morphological changes of the spheres. Expert judgement is additionally applied, if the confidence interval is very wide (BMCU/BMCL > 25) which means a high uncertainty for the BMC estimation.",Medium,"The answer provides a detailed description of the prediction models for both downregulation and upregulation, including hit classifications and decision processes.

Next to the hit definition, the uncertainty given by the 95 % CI is also considered in the specificity analyses (see 8.2 for a more detailed description). The model has been tested on a set of 17 DNT negative- and 9 DNT positive compounds (see 5.6 and 5.7).

The answer is partially complete but lacks clarity and comprehensiveness in addressing all aspects of the question.","The prediction model (PM) for the NPC1 assay is set up as a statistical model that uses 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to determine the uncertainty of a hit definition.

- DNT positive compounds: Cadmium chloride, Dexamethasone, Hexachlorophene, Chlorpromazine hydrochloride, Methylazoxymethanol acetate, all-trans-Retinoic acid, Tributyltin chloride, Sodium valproate.
- DNT negative compounds: Acetaminophen, Amoxicillin, Aspirin, Buspirone, Chlorpheniramine maleate, D-Glucitol, Diethylene glycol, D-Mannitol, Doxylamine succinate, Famotidine, Ibuprofen, Metformin, Metoprolol, Penicillin VK, Saccharin, Sodium benzoate, Warfarin.

The process is documented in publications, including Masjosthusmann et al. (2020) and Blum et al. (2023) _(Sources: NPC1.pdf)_.

The PM applies to changes in both directions (up/down). For downregulation, the PM uses hit definitions based on comparisons of CIs for the DNT-specific endpoint and the unspecific endpoint (cytotoxicity/viability). If a compound is classified as a hit along with a reduction in an unspecific endpoint, it needs to be clarified if the induction is a specific effect or an artifact due to a loss in cell viability or an increase in cytotoxicity. 

In contrast, for upregulation, the PM does not compare CIs between specific and unspecific endpoints, as an increase in cell health does not necessarily correlate with increased cell proliferation. The interpretation of data in the opposite direction is handled through expert judgment, which considers effect size, curve progression, statistical significance, and overall standard deviation. 

Different rules and interpretations apply to the two sides of the PM. A decrease in viability or an increase in viability can both be interpreted as an effect, but the thresholds and performance characteristics may differ between the two sides _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.",0.7359134974111343,0.2656138241291046,-0.006444103084504604,0.11776413768529892

Inter-experimental variation (raw) is the variability as CV between the raw SC across all independent experiments (n>360) before normalization. Inter-experimental variation (low conc.) is the variability as CV across all independent experiments (n>390) after normalization based on the response of the lowest test concentration. It is assumed that the lowest test concentration does not affect any of the endpoints measured. Inter-experimental variation (positive controls) is the variability of the positive control across all independent experiments (n>360) after normalization. For further detail, see Fig. 7. Positive control: proliferation media without growth factors (EGF, FGF) Table 1 summarizes the assay performance in terms of variability of each endpoint in the assay. This variability spans different individuals where cells were derived from. Table 1: Assay variability quantified as CV. Inter-experimental variation (positive controls) is only given for specific endpoints. Sensitivity and specificity of the NPC1 assay are determined based on a set of 9 predicted human DNT positive compounds and 17 predicted human DNT negative compounds (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020; Blum et al., 2023). Based on this compound set the following performance parameters are obtained for the NPC1 assay. Specificity: 100 % Sensitivity: 33% Here, it is important to mention, that it is not expected that the NPC1 assay identifies all DNT positive compounds as not all of those compounds act via an effect on cell proliferation on the developing brain. For most compounds the exact MoA for their neurodevelopmental adversity is not precisely known, yet other mechanisms like neuron/glia differentiation, neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis and neuronal network formation are amongst the known DNT MoAs.

It is specifically noted that the NPC1 assay should be included in a battery of assays to provide a comprehensive assessment of neurodevelopmental toxicity, as it focuses on NPC proliferation during the fetal period _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.

### Strengths and Weaknesses in a Test Battery:
- **Strengths:**
  - The NPC1 assay is effective for screening and identifying compounds that may adversely affect fetal brain development through their impact on neural progenitor cell proliferation.
  - It serves as a good confirmation assay for compounds known to cause DNT, as it has demonstrated specificity in identifying DNT-positive compounds _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.
  - The assay can provide mechanistic insights into how certain chemicals may disrupt neurodevelopmental processes.

- **Weaknesses:**
  - The assay has a sensitivity of only 33%, meaning it may not identify all DNT-positive compounds, particularly those that do not affect cell proliferation directly _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.
  - It does not cover all neurodevelopmental processes, such as neuronal differentiation or synaptogenesis, which are critical for a complete assessment of DNT _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.

### Comparison to Similar Tests:
The NPC1 assay is compared to other assays that measure neurodevelopmental toxicity, such as the hNP1 assay, which uses a different cell type and methodology (2D monolayer vs. 3D spheres). The NPC1 assay's use of primary human neural progenitor cells allows it to reflect in vivo conditions more closely during the fetal phase, which may provide advantages over other methods that do not utilize human-derived cells _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.

### Gaps Filled in a Test Battery:
The NPC1 assay fills gaps related to the assessment of fetal NPC proliferation, which is a critical aspect of neurodevelopment that may not be adequately addressed by other assays. It specifically targets the early stages of brain development, making it a valuable addition to a DNT test battery _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.

### Tier Usage and Complementary Assays:
The NPC1 assay is suggested to be used in the first tier of a DNT test battery, as it provides initial screening for potential neurotoxic effects. However, due to its limitations in sensitivity and the range of neurodevelopmental processes it assesses, complementary assays are recommended to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of DNT. Therefore, while it can be a stand-alone method for initial screening, it is best utilized in conjunction with other assays to cover the broader spectrum of neurodevelopmental endpoints _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_.",0.710192427143819,0.1896471530199051,-0.11164936423301697,0.022534765303134918

The response lacks clarity and completeness in addressing the question.,"The mechanistic validation of the NPC1 assay has been explored through omics characterization and the use of endpoint-specific controls. The assay utilizes primary human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) derived from fetal brain cortices, which reflect key processes of brain development relevant to developmental neurotoxicity (DNT). 

Omics approaches have been employed to analyze the transcriptomic profiles of proliferating and differentiated hNPCs, identifying several neurodevelopmental processes and associated signaling pathways, such as migration and differentiation (Masjosthusmann et al., 2018). This indicates that the assay captures important biological processes that are relevant to human neurodevelopment.

Additionally, the assay incorporates endpoint-specific controls to validate its functionality. For instance, the proliferation of hNPCs is assessed in the presence and absence of growth factors (EGF and FGF), which serves as a positive control demonstrating the physiological regulation of hNPC proliferation (Source: NPC1.pdf).

Overall, the NPC1 assay reflects human biology by utilizing primary cells from the fetal human cortex, which are relevant for assessing neurodevelopmental toxicity, and it has been characterized to ensure that it captures essential signaling pathways and biological processes pertinent to the form of toxicity being evaluated.
