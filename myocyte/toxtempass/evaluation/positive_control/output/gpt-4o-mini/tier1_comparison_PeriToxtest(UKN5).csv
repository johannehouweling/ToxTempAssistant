3. **Cell Lot Variability**: Differences between vials of one cell ""lot"" can affect performance.

4. **Medium and Supplement Variability**: Different lots of medium and supplements can introduce variability in cell behavior.

**Critical Consumables or Batch Effects**:
- **Fetal Calf Serum (FCS)**: Batch effects of critical additives like FCS can lead to differentiation of cells at low passage numbers.
- **Trypsin Type**: The type of trypsin used can affect cell detachment and viability.
- **Apo-Transferrin vs. Holo-Transferrin**: The specific type of transferrin can influence cell growth and differentiation.

**Critical Handling Steps and Influencing Factors**:
- **Pipetting**: Special care is needed in pipetting to avoid introducing air bubbles or damaging cells. Pipetting should be performed slowly.
- **Time Sensitivity**: Steps that need to be performed quickly include cell seeding and medium changes to minimize the time cells are at room temperature.
- **Cell Density**: Too low or too high cell density can lead to detachment of cells or spontaneous differentiation.
- **Washing Procedures**: Care must be taken during washing to avoid detaching cells.

However, it lacks information on the percentage of contaminating cells, the percentage of each subpopulation in co-cultures, and whether specific chemicals show differential cytotoxicity for the cell sub-populations. These omissions prevent a full understanding of the test system's characteristics and potential influences on viability measures.","The test system used in the PeriTox assay involves human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived immature dorsal root ganglia (iDRG) neurons. The generation of this test system includes differentiation steps from the hiPSC line EPITHELIAL-1, which is cultured under feeder-free conditions and then differentiated into peripheral neurons.

### General Features/Principles of the Culture Protocol:
1. **Cell Source**: The hiPSC line EPITHELIAL-1 is derived from epithelial cells and is maintained in Essential 8 (E8) medium on Laminin-521 coated plastic dishes. The cells are passaged every 5-7 days and can be used for differentiation from passage 2 to passage 8.

2. **Differentiation Process**: 
   - The differentiation towards immature peripheral neurons begins by replating the hiPSCs in a single-cell suspension onto Matrigel-coated plates in E8 medium supplemented with a ROCK inhibitor.
   - Neural differentiation is initiated by adding a neural differentiation medium (KSR) along with small molecule pathway inhibitors over several days.
   - On day 9 of differentiation, the cells are cryopreserved for later use.

3. **Culture Conditions**: The differentiated immature neurons are thawed and seeded on Matrigel-coated plates in a specific medium (75% N2-S medium and 25% KSR medium) supplemented with additional compounds to support growth and differentiation.

### Contamination and Subpopulations:
- The assay does not specify the exact percentage of contaminating cells; however, it is noted that contaminating, non-neuronal cells might be present during the differentiation process for unknown reasons.
- There is no detailed information provided regarding the percentage of each subpopulation in co-cultures or whether specific subpopulations are more sensitive to cytotoxicity.

### Differential Sensitivity to Cytotoxicity:
- The document does not provide specific information on whether certain chemicals or chemical classes show differential cytotoxicity for the cell sub-populations used in the assay.

Overall, while the test system is well-defined in terms of its generation and culture conditions, specific details regarding contamination levels, subpopulation sensitivity, and differential cytotoxicity are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)_",0.6917281331765196,0.1958772838115692,-0.048662133514881134,0.06435294449329376

However, it lacks detailed acceptance criteria, specific analytical methods, and historical control data. It also does not specify actions if acceptance criteria are not met.","The acceptance criteria for the PeriTox test system at the start of toxicity testing include the following endpoints and parameters:

1. **Endpoints for Quality Control:**
   - **Neurite Growth:** Visual inspection of neurite growth and appearance of control cells before live staining.
   - **Cell Attachment:** Cells should be attached to the plate and appear flattened at the edges when the toxicant treatment is applied.
   - **Expression of Neuronal Markers:** Cells are checked for the expression of sensory neuronal markers such as Brn3A, Islet-1, peripherin, and βIII tubulin on days 1, 4, and 7 after thawing.

2. **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - Control cells should have properly grown neurites, with neurite area quantification (via Cellomics) exceeding 150,000 in the control wells.
   - Cells should be >90% viable, as determined by live staining with calcein-AM and Hoechst H-33342.

3. **Analytical Methods:**
   - **High-Content Imaging:** Cells are stained with calcein-AM to mark viable cells and Hoechst H-33342 to identify any cell. The imaging is performed using a Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS reader.
   - **Quantification of Neurite Outgrowth:** An automated image analysis algorithm is used to quantify neurite area and viable cell count based on the staining.

4. **Historical Controls:**
   - The performance of the test system regarding acceptance criteria is monitored across multiple differentiation runs. For example, the average neurite area and cell viability are assessed over several experiments to establish baseline values and variations.

5. **Actions if Acceptance Criteria are Not Met:**
   - If the neurite area is below 150,000 or cell viability is below 90%, the cells should be discarded, and a new batch of cells should be thawed for the experiment.

These criteria ensure that the test system is functioning as expected before proceeding with toxicity testing, thereby enhancing the reliability of the assay results _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)_.",0.7433957204686464,0.4119069278240204,-0.011678270995616913,0.16822153329849243

The response is not fully complete or clear in addressing all aspects of the question.","The acceptance criteria for the PeriTox test system focus on the quality of the immature dorsal root ganglia (iDRG) neurons used in the assay. The following parameters are considered important:

1. **Cell Attachment**: Cells should be attached to the plate and appear flattened at the edges when the toxicant treatment is applied. There are no quantifiable criteria before toxicant treatment, but neurite growth and the appearance of control cells are visually checked.

2. **Neurite Area**: For negative controls, the neurite area quantification must be greater than 150,000 pixels in the control wells. This serves as a benchmark for assessing the neurite growth.

3. **Cell Viability**: The percentage of viable cells is assessed, with a requirement that control cells maintain a high viability rate, typically above 90% compared to the solvent control.

4. **Differentiation Markers**: The expression of sensory neuronal markers such as Brn3A, Islet-1, peripherin, and βIII tubulin is checked on days 1, 4, and 7 after thawing to ensure proper differentiation.

5. **Historical Controls**: The performance of the test system is evaluated based on historical data. For instance, the average neurite area and cell viability from multiple differentiation runs are monitored to establish baseline values and their variations.

If the acceptance criteria are not met, actions include discarding the experiment and thawing a new batch of cells. For example, if the average neurite length falls below a specified threshold (e.g., 25 μm), the experiment would be considered invalid and discarded. 

These criteria ensure that the test system is functioning correctly and that the results obtained are reliable and reproducible.

However, it lacks clarity and completeness as it does not mention critical handling steps, positive and negative controls, expected values, accepted deviations, or recommendations for reproducibility and performance.","The known causes of variability for the final test system state in the PeriToxtest (UKN5) include:

1. **Differentiation Variability**: Contaminating, non-neuronal cells might be present in some differentiations for unknown reasons during the differentiation process.

2. **Plate and Flask Variability**: Different plastic materials from various manufacturers can lead to variability in cell attachment and growth.

3. **Cell Lot Variability**: Differences between vials of one cell ""lot"" can affect performance.

4. **Medium and Supplement Batch Effects**: Variability can arise from different lots of medium and supplements, which may affect cell behavior.

**Critical Consumables and Batch Effects**:
- **Plates/Flasks**: Variability can occur due to differences in plastic from different suppliers.
- **FCS or Serum Replacement**: Batch effects of critical additives (e.g., holo-transferrin, TGF-β) can lead to differentiation of cells at low passage numbers.

**Critical Handling Steps and Influencing Factors**:
- **Pipetting**: Special care is needed in pipetting to avoid introducing variability. Pipetting should be performed slowly and with precision.
- **Cell Density**: Too low or too high cell density can lead to detachment of cells or spontaneous differentiation. Cells should be maintained as colonies and not as single cells.
- **Timeliness**: Steps such as cell seeding and medium changes should be performed as quickly as possible to minimize the time cells spend at room temperature.

**Positive and Negative Controls**:
- **Positive Control**: Narciclasine (50 nM final concentration) should yield a neurite area ≤ 75% of DMSO control and viability ≥ 90% of DMSO control.
- **Negative Control**: DMSO should yield a neurite area ≥ 150,000.

**Accepted Deviation**:
- The acceptance criteria for the positive control are that neurite area should be ≤ 75% of the DMSO control, and viability should be ≥ 90% of the DMSO control. The negative control should meet the neurite area criteria as specified.

**Recommendations to Increase/Ensure Reproducibility and Performance**:
- Regularly check and maintain the expression of pluripotency markers in iPSCs.
- Use consistent and high-quality consumables from the same supplier to minimize batch effects.
- Train operators thoroughly in cell culture techniques and the specific requirements of the assay.
- Implement strict protocols for pipetting and handling to reduce variability.
- Conduct experiments in a controlled environment to minimize external influences on cell behavior.

Co-staining with Hoechst H-33342 allows the identification of any cell. Cells are stained for 30 min at 37°C and 5% CO2 in the incubator. The cell staining is imaged in a Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS reader. Hoechst H-33342 staining is imaged in channel 1 (UV-Hoechst); calcein staining is imaged in channel 2 (Green-FITC). Exposure times are set manually. To measure the neurite area, the software acquires the Hoechst signal in channel 1 to identify the cells as objects (via identification of the nuclei), and the calcein-AM signal in channel 2 to measure neurite area. Double positive cells are counted as viable.",Medium,"The answer provides a partial overview of the analytical method, including staining and imaging steps, but lacks a comprehensive description of the principles behind the method. It does not clearly explain whether the endpoints are measured in the same well or independently, nor does it provide details on the quantification algorithm or the number of cells imaged. The response is somewhat specific but not sufficiently detailed for a full understanding of the method's principles.","The PeriTox test (UKN5) employs high-content imaging to assess two key endpoints: neurite area and cell viability. The analytical methods used in this assay are based on the following principles:

1. **Cell Staining**: Cells are live-stained with calcein-AM to mark viable cells and Hoechst H-33342 to identify all cells. This dual staining allows for the simultaneous assessment of both neurite outgrowth and cell viability.

2. **Imaging**: After a 24-hour exposure to treatment compounds, cells are imaged using a high-content microscope (Cellomics VTI Array Scan). The imaging process captures multiple fields per well, typically ten fields, to ensure a representative sample of the cell population.

3. **Quantification**: The quantification of neurite area and cell viability is performed using image analysis algorithms. The software identifies nuclei in the Hoechst channel to determine cell count and neurite area in the calcein channel. The neurite area is calculated by identifying neurite pixels while excluding the cell soma, ensuring accurate measurement of neurite growth.

4. **Simultaneous Measurement**: Both endpoints (neurite area and cell viability) are measured in the same well under the same conditions, allowing for a direct comparison of the effects of compounds on both parameters.

In summary, the key steps of the analytical method include:
- Live staining of cells with calcein-AM and Hoechst H-33342.
- Imaging of cells using a high-content microscope.
- Automated analysis of images to quantify neurite area and viable cell count.
- Measurement of both endpoints in parallel within the same well.

This approach allows for efficient data collection and analysis, providing insights into the neurotoxic effects of compounds on peripheral neurons. The assay typically images a substantial number of cells across multiple fields to ensure statistical relevance in the results _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)_.",0.705813298639073,0.24245542287826538,0.03079584240913391,0.13088420033454895
"Provide information on machine settings, analytical standards, data processing and normalization procedures. For imaging endpoints: provide detailed algorithm. This information should also be covered in an SOP, preferably in DB-ALM format (see link in 6.6).","Quantification of neurite outgrowth An automated microplate reading microscope (Array-ScanII HCS Reader, Cellomics, PA) equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera (resolution 1024 x 1024; run at 2 x 2 binning) was used for image acquisition. Ten fields per well were imaged. Images were recorded in 2 channels using a 20x objective and excitation/emission wavelengths of 365 ± 50/535 ± 45 to detect H-33342 in channel 1 and 474 ± 40/535 ± 45 to detect calcein in channel 2. In both channels, a fixed exposure time and an intensity histogram-derived threshold were used for object identification. Neurite pixels were identified using the following image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified as objects in channel 1 according to their size, area, shape, and intensity which were predefined on untreated cells using a machine-based learning algorithm, and manual selection of nuclei to be classified as intact. The nuclear outlines were expanded by 3.2 µm in each direction, to define a virtual cell soma area (VCSA) based on the following procedure: The average width of the cytoplasm ring (distance nucleus - cell membrane) of LUHMES cells was experimentally determined to be 2.3 µm. Size irregularities were not always due to growing neurites, as determined by combined F-actin/tubulin beta-III staining. To avoid scoring of false positive neurite areas, the exclusion ring (VCSA) was made bigger than the average cell size. Then, we used two control compounds (U0126 and bisindolylmaleimid I) to vary the expanded outlines from 0.6 to 4 µm. We found 3.2 µm to be optimal both to detect neurite growth over time and to identify reduced neurite growth with high sensitivity. All calcein-positive pixels of the field (beyond a given intensity threshold) were defined as viable cellular structures (VCSs). The threshold was dynamically determined for each field after flat field and background correction and intensity normalization to 512 gray values and was set to 12% of the maximal brightness (channel 63 of 512). The VCS defines the sum of all somata and neurites without their assignment to individual cells. In an automatic calculation, the VCSAs, defined in the H- 33342 channel, were used as filter in the calcein channel and subtracted from the VCS. The remaining pixels (VCS - VCSA) in the calcein channel were defined as neurite area. Quantification of individual viable cells by imaging For a quantitative assessment of viable cells, the same images used to assess neurite area were analyzed using another image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified in channel 1 as objects according to their size, area, shape, and intensity. Nuclei of apoptotic cells with increased fluorescence were excluded. A VCSA was defined around each nucleus by expanding it by 0.3 µm into each direction. Calcein-AM staining, labeling live cells, was detected in channel 2. The algorithm quantified the calcein intensity in the VCSA areas. Cells having an average calcein signal intensity in the VCSAs below a predefined threshold were classified by the program as “not viable”. Valid nuclei with a positive calcein signal in their cognate VCSA were counted as viable cells. A positive calcein signal was based on measurements of the average intensity (normal cells: 1300 ± 115, threshold: < 50) and the total integrated intensity (normal cells: 186,000 ± 23,600, threshold < 1000) of cells.",Medium,"The answer provides detailed information on the imaging endpoints, including the algorithm used for image analysis and the machine settings for image acquisition.

The assay usually employs three compounds per plate, with six different concentrations of each compound per plate, and three technical replicates per plate, resulting in a total of 18 data points per plate. 

For defining starting dilutions, the highest compound concentration is diluted with medium at a ratio of 1:250 without DMSO, as the final concentration of DMSO is kept at 0.1%.

Here are the details regarding the statistics of the benchmark response:

(i) **Dichotomized Data Prediction Model:**
- A result is considered **toxic** if the neurite area is ≤ 75% of the DMSO control and the viability is ≥ 90% of the DMSO control. If these conditions are not met, the result is considered **not toxic** _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)_.

(ii) **Pseudo-Dichotomized Outcomes:**
- For borderline cases, a ratio of BMC25 Viability (V) / BMC25 Neurite Area (NA) ≥ 3 is considered a borderline hit. This indicates that while the compound may not be definitively classified as toxic, it shows potential for neurotoxic effects that warrant further investigation _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)_.

(iii) **Multi-Class or Continuous Outcomes:**
- The test primarily focuses on two classes (toxic and non-toxic) with a borderline class in between. The rationale for the thresholds is based on biological relevance, specifically the impact on neurite growth and cell viability. The thresholds are set to reflect significant deviations from control values, which are biologically meaningful in the context of neurotoxicity _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)_.

**Rationale for Threshold:**
- The thresholds are based on both mathematical and biological considerations. The use of a 3-fold standard deviation from the mean of control values is a common statistical approach to define significant effects. Additionally, the biological rationale is supported by the need to maintain at least 80% viability to ensure that observed effects on neurite growth are not confounded by cell death _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)_.

**Toxicological Rationale:**
- The thresholds are designed to predict adverse outcomes related to peripheral neuropathies, which are critical for assessing developmental neurotoxicity. The model aims to identify compounds that may disrupt neuronal development or function, which is essential for regulatory assessments _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)_.

**Limitations of the Prediction Model:**
- The model has not undergone formal validation through OECD guidelines, and while it has been tested with a variety of compounds, the lack of a standardized ring trial may limit its applicability across different laboratories. Additionally, the model may not capture all aspects of neurotoxicity covered by in vivo studies _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)_.

**Hit Definition in Screening Mode:**
- In screening mode, a ""hit"" is defined as a compound that causes a significant decrease in neurite area while maintaining cell viability above the specified threshold. This indicates that the compound may have specific neurotoxic effects that require further evaluation _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)_.",0.7879602258138726,0.18291054666042328,-0.014421852305531502,0.07955752313137054

Has the prediction model been tested (what was the test set of chemicals)? List chemicals or give n, if n > 50. Is the process documented (publication)? Does the prediction model (PM) apply to changes to both sides of controls (up/down)? If the PM is one-sided (e.g. toxicants leading to a decrease vs. control), how are data in the opposite direction handled and interpreted? If the PM is two-sided, do different rules, characteristics and interpretations apply to the two sides (e.g. is a decrease in viability or an increase in viability both interpreted as an effect/toxicity; are thresholds and performance characteristics to both sides the same?).","To design the initial prediction model for the PeriTox test, we took the following steps: (a) use of the “ratio” of EC50 (viability)/EC50 (neurites) as the primary endpoint (b) measurement of this value for “unspecific toxicants” (the uncoupler CCCP, SDS, Triton- X100, and the topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide; the average ratio was 1.376±0.39) (c) definition of a “noise band” (4SD from the average of the ratios of these compounds) (d) definition of compounds with a ratio outside the noise band (EC50 ratio of >3) as “neurite specific.” The use of the updated prediction model BMC25 Viability (V) / BMC25 Neurite Area (NA) ≥ 3 was validated by comparing classifications derived by the initial and the updated prediction model. The reason for updating the prediction model was that a decrease of 50% in neurite area and viability cannot always be achieved with our range of test concentrations but to reach an effect of 25% is more reasonable. The initial prediction model therefore often used EC50 values that were only based on a pure mathematical curve fit. However, the now used BMC25 is more related to the data that was practically obtained. The prediction model has been applied to screen 80 compound library of NTP (Delp et al., 2018). The prediction model including the borderline classification has been applied to screen a 120 compound library (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020).",Medium,"The answer provides some details on the setup and validation of the prediction model, including the use of EC50 ratios and the application to specific compound libraries. However, it lacks clarity on the specific classifiers or statistical approaches used, does not fully address whether the model is one-sided or two-sided, and does not discuss how data in the opposite direction is handled. Additionally, while it mentions publications, it does not clearly document the entire process or address all aspects of the question comprehensively.","The prediction model for the PeriTox test was set up using the following steps:

1. **Training Set of Chemicals**: The initial prediction model was designed using a set of ""unspecific toxicants"" which included compounds such as CCCP, SDS, Triton-X100, and the topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide. The average ratio of EC50 values for these compounds was calculated to establish a baseline for the model _(Source: 8. Prediction model and toxicological application)_.

2. **Statistical Approaches**: The model utilized a ratio of EC50 (viability) to EC50 (neurites) as the primary endpoint. A ""noise band"" was defined based on the average of the ratios of the unspecific toxicants, and compounds with a ratio outside this noise band were classified as ""neurite specific"" _(Source: 8. Prediction model and toxicological application)_.

3. **Testing the Prediction Model**: The prediction model has been tested with a total of 145 unique compounds, and it has been applied in screening campaigns, including an 80 compound library from the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) and a 120 compound library for developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) assessment _(Source: 9. Publication / validation status)_.

4. **Documentation**: The process and results of the prediction model have been documented in several publications, including:
   - Hoelting, L. et al. Stem Cells Transl Med, 2016.
   - Delp, J. et al. Altex, 2018.
   - Krebs, A. et al. Arch. Toxicol., 2020.
   - Masjosthusmann, S. et al. EFSA Supporting Publications, 2020 _(Source: 9. Publication / validation status)_.

5. **Application of the Prediction Model**: The prediction model is primarily designed to detect decreases in neurite area while maintaining viability. It is one-sided in that it focuses on identifying neurotoxic effects (i.e., a decrease in neurite area) while ensuring that viability remains above a certain threshold (≥ 90% of DMSO control) _(Source: 8. Prediction model and toxicological application)_.

6. **Handling Data in the Opposite Direction**: Data showing an increase in viability or no effect are not classified as neurotoxic. The model does not interpret increases in viability as an effect or toxicity. Therefore, the thresholds and performance characteristics are not applied to both sides; the focus remains on detecting neurotoxic effects through decreases in neurite area _(Source: 8. Prediction model and toxicological application)_.

In summary, the prediction model is primarily one-sided, focusing on detecting decreases in neurite area as indicative of neurotoxicity, with specific thresholds for viability that must be maintained.",0.9183220783254461,0.26174286007881165,0.12677910923957825,0.19393083453178406

Several performance parameters for the test were obtained in several separate evaluation rounds. A first evaluation was done during the first publication of the model and its applications (Hoelting et al. 2016). Here, a panel of well-selected positive and negative controls have been tested. Accordingly, the specificity was 100% and the sensitivity was > 90 %. In dedicated experiments, S/N ratios of > 20 and a z’ of > 0.5 have been determined. Operator reproducibility was shown in Hoelting et al. 2016 (Supplementary 3) for the compound colchicine. The test has been used in screening campaigns, and real-live performance data under broader screen conditions have been obtained. The different performance data need to be considered, when a compound is a hit in a screen, or whether it has been specifically evaluated in a hit follow-up or a mechanistic project. A first screen application has been the NTP80 screen (80 compounds provided by the US NTP). Data are published Delp et al. 2018. A second screen application has been the cross systems case study of the EU-ToxRisk project. The baseline variation is indicated in Krebs et al., 2020. Moreover, an overview is given for 19 compounds on the BMC/BMCL ratio as measure of readout certainty. A third screen was performed in the context of the EFSA DNT test battery evaluation with 120 compounds (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). From this screen the following performance indicators were obtained: A: Sensitivity: 100%  With PeriTox as standalone assay in 17 `tool negatives´ tested (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020).

D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) is the variability across all independent experiments (n>200) after normalization based on the response of the lowest test concentration. It was assumed that the lowest test concentration does not affect any of the endpoints measured.",High,"The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the test method's performance parameters, including specificity, sensitivity, signal/noise ratio, z-factor, baseline variation, and inter-operator variations.

It is currently used in the setup of a DNT test battery, specifically designed to assess the effects of chemical exposure on the developing peripheral nervous system. 

**Strengths of the PeriTox test in a test battery:**
- It is a medium to high throughput assay, allowing for the screening of multiple compounds efficiently.
- The test is sensitive to cytoskeletal toxicants and some signaling modifiers, making it effective for identifying specific neurotoxicants and developmental toxicants.
- It provides a mechanistic understanding of neurotoxicity, as it measures adverse effects on neurite growth and cell viability, which are critical for neuronal function.

**Weaknesses of the PeriTox test in a test battery:**
- The test has not undergone formal validation (e.g., OECD 34 validation study), which may limit its acceptance in regulatory contexts.
- It may not cover all aspects of neurotoxicity assessed in in vivo studies, as it predicts some but not all aspects covered by traditional neurotoxicity studies.

**Comparison to similar tests:**
The PeriTox test specifically measures neurite outgrowth in peripheral neurons, distinguishing it from other assays that may focus on central neurons or broader neurotoxic effects. For example, it has been shown that toxicants known to induce peripheral neuropathies have specific effects in the PeriTox test but not in tests designed for central neurons.

**Gaps filled by the PeriTox test:**
The test method addresses the need for a specific assay that evaluates the effects of compounds on peripheral neurons, which is not typically covered by other neurotoxicity assays. It provides insights into the potential for developmental neurotoxicity, particularly in the context of chemical exposure during fetal development.

**Use in test tiers:**
The PeriTox test is recommended for preferential use in the first tier of a DNT test battery. It serves as a stand-alone method for assessing chemical effects on peripheral neurons without requiring complementary assays for the endpoints it investigates. 

Overall, the PeriTox test is a valuable addition to a DNT test battery, providing specific insights into peripheral neurotoxicity while also being efficient for high-throughput screening of compounds _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)_.",0.7377685210719583,0.27631938457489014,0.106898732483387,0.1892174482345581
