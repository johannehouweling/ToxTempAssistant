   - **Cell Density:** Maintaining an appropriate cell density is crucial; confluency should not exceed 40-90% to ensure optimal growth and differentiation _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_.
   - **Washing Procedures:** Proper washing procedures after coating and during medium changes are essential to remove any residual substances that could affect cell behavior _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_.

3. **Recommendations to Increase/Ensure Reproducibility and Performance:**
   - **Consistent Use of Consumables:** Use the same suppliers for critical consumables (e.g., plasticware, FCS) to minimize batch-to-batch variability _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_.
   - **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly check for mycoplasma contamination and perform visual inspections of cell morphology to ensure healthy cultures _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_.
   - **Standardized Protocols:** Follow standardized protocols for cell culture and differentiation to reduce variability in experimental outcomes _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_.

The generation of the test system includes specific differentiation steps, as detailed in section 3.6 of the context.

**General Features/Principles of the Culture Protocol:**
1. **Differentiation Process:**
   - LUHMES cells are maintained in a proliferation medium containing basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) until they reach a sufficient density.
   - Differentiation is initiated by changing the medium to a differentiation medium that includes tetracycline, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and dibutyryl-cAMP (cAMP). This process occurs over a period of 6 days, during which the cells develop into mature dopamine-like neurons.

2. **Coating of Culture Plates:**
   - The culture plates are coated with a poly-L-ornithine (PLO) and fibronectin solution to promote cell attachment and growth.

3. **Cell Density and Replating:**
   - After 2 days of differentiation, the cells are replated into 96-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells/cm² for the assay.

**Contamination and Subpopulation Sensitivity:**
- The LUHMES cells must be pathogen-free, and regular testing for mycoplasma is conducted. The acceptable level of cell death is approximately 5-10%, with increased cell death justifying the discard of the cell batch.
- The context does not specify the exact percentage of contaminating cells or the composition of subpopulations in co-cultures, as LUHMES cells are primarily used in a monolayer culture for this assay.

**Sensitivity to Cytotoxicity:**
- The context does not provide specific information on whether certain subpopulations are more sensitive to cytotoxicity than others or if this could influence viability measures. However, it is noted that LUHMES cells are highly sensitive to toxicants, and cell death is easily quantified.

**Differential Cytotoxicity:**
- The context does not mention specific chemicals or chemical classes that show differential cytotoxicity for the cell sub-populations used in the assay.

Overall, the NeuriTox assay utilizes a well-defined culture protocol for LUHMES cells, focusing on their differentiation into dopaminergic neurons, but lacks detailed information on contamination levels, subpopulation sensitivity, and differential cytotoxicity of specific chemicals. _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_",0.7359558523591478,0.14971384406089783,-0.06609204411506653,0.03527013957500458

These criteria focus on the morphology, viability, and differentiation status of the LUHMES cells used in the assay.

1. **Endpoints for Acceptance Criteria:**
   - **Morphology:** Cells should have neurites approximately as long as their cell bodies when trypsinized for re-plating.
   - **Contamination:** Cells must not be contaminated.
   - **Confluency:** The confluency of the cells should be about 60%.

2. **Analytical Methods:**
   - **Visual Inspection:** The criteria are primarily based on visual inspection rather than quantitative measurements.
   - **Staining:** Cells are stained with Hoechst H-33342 to identify nuclei and assess cell viability through calcein-AM staining.

3. **Values to be Reached:**
   - Cells should exhibit the expected morphology with neurites extending from the cell bodies.
   - The culture should not show signs of contamination.
   - A confluency of around 60% is desired.

4. **Historical Controls:**
   - The performance of the test system regarding acceptance criteria is monitored through historical data. For example, when differentiation is performed multiple times, the average and variation of the values for the acceptance criteria parameters are recorded to ensure consistency.

5. **Actions if Acceptance Criteria are Not Met:**
   - If the cells do not meet the acceptance criteria, such as showing high levels of contamination or improper morphology, the batch may be discarded, and a new cell batch should be prepared. 

These criteria ensure that the cultures used in the NeuriTox assay are of high quality and suitable for assessing the effects of toxicants on neurite outgrowth and cell viability _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_.",0.6776058155039469,0.266116738319397,-0.0897827222943306,0.06466303020715714

The response is incomplete and lacks clarity.","The acceptance criteria for the NeuriTox assay (UKN4) regarding the test system are as follows:

1. **Acceptance Criteria at the Start of the Test System:**
   - Cells should have neurites approximately as long as their cell bodies when trypsinized for re-plating.
   - Cells must not be contaminated.
   - Cells should have a confluency of about 60%.
   - At the moment of treatment, cells should not be completely attached to the plate and should appear round when viewed under a microscope.
   - These criteria are primarily based on visual inspection and are not quantified.

2. **Acceptance Criteria at the End of Compound Exposure:**
   - Negative controls should show neurites that are at least as long as the cell bodies.
   - The culture medium should not be orange/yellow.
   - Appropriate cell density should be maintained.
   - Similar to the start criteria, these are also based on visual inspection and are not quantified.

3. **Variability and Troubleshooting:**
   - Variability can arise from issues such as problems with coating, different cell passages, and differences in plastic ware or medium.
   - If cells are too confluent, it can impair metabolism and slow differentiation, leading to the decision to discard the cell batch.

4. **Historical Controls:**
   - The document does not provide specific historical control data regarding the average and variation of the values for the acceptance criteria parameters after multiple differentiation runs.

5. **Actions if Acceptance Criteria are Not Met:**
   - If the acceptance criteria are not met, actions include discarding the cell batch or experiment. For example, if the average neurite length is below the expected threshold, the experiment would be discarded.

These criteria ensure that the cells used in the assay are of sufficient quality to yield reliable and reproducible results. However, specific numerical values for historical controls and detailed statistical data are not provided in the context.

However, it lacks specific details on critical consumables, handling steps, and controls with expected values and deviations. Recommendations for reproducibility are also not fully covered.","The NeuriTox assay (UKN4) has several known causes of variability for the final test system state, which include:

1. **Critical Consumables or Batch Effects:**
   - Variability can arise from different batches of plastic ware (e.g., plates and flasks) as the plastic might behave differently depending on the manufacturer and lot.
   - Variability in the quality of coating solutions (PLO/fibronectin) can lead to uneven cell distribution and clumping.
   - Different batches of culture medium and supplements can also introduce variability.

2. **Critical Handling Steps and Influencing Factors:**
   - **Pipetting:** Special care is needed during pipetting to ensure that substances are added correctly. If pipette tips are too high above the medium surface, droplets may stick to the well walls instead of mixing with the medium.
   - **Timing:** Steps such as cell seeding and medium changes should be performed quickly to minimize the time cells spend at room temperature.
   - **Cell Density:** Maintaining an appropriate cell density is crucial; confluency should not exceed 40-90% to avoid impaired metabolism and slow differentiation.

3. **Positive and Negative Controls:**
   - **Positive Control:** Narciclasine (50 nM final concentration) is used as a positive control for neurite growth inhibition. Expected values are that neurite area should be ≤ 75% of the DMSO control, and viability should be ≥ 90% of the DMSO control (or not significantly changed).
   - **Negative Control:** Solvent (0.1% DMSO final concentration) should yield a neurite area ≥ 35,000.

4. **Accepted Deviation:**
   - The accepted deviation for positive control results is that neurite area should be within ±20% of the expected values across different test repeats.
   - For negative controls, the neurite area should consistently meet the threshold of ≥ 35,000.

5. **Recommendations to Increase/Ensure Reproducibility and Performance:**
   - Use the same supplier for critical consumables to minimize batch variability.
   - Regularly check and calibrate pipetting devices to ensure accuracy.
   - Maintain consistent environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) in the cell culture incubator.
   - Implement strict protocols for cell handling and ensure that all personnel are trained to follow these protocols.
   - Conduct regular quality control checks on cell batches and culture media to ensure they meet the required standards before use.
   - Document all experimental conditions and any deviations to facilitate troubleshooting and improve reproducibility in future experiments.

However, there are several differences and gaps in analogy between this test system and actual human tissue that need to be considered:

1. **Developmental Stage**: The LUHMES cells are used at an early developmental stage (day 2 of differentiation), which may not fully represent the complexity and maturity of adult human dopaminergic neurons found in vivo. This could affect the assay's ability to predict neurotoxic effects accurately in fully developed human tissues.

2. **Cellular Environment**: The assay is conducted in a controlled in vitro environment, lacking the complex interactions and signaling pathways present in the human brain, such as those involving glial cells, extracellular matrix components, and other neuronal types. This simplification may limit the physiological relevance of the findings.

3. **Neuronal Network Formation**: While LUHMES cells can form neuronal networks, the extent and functionality of these networks may not fully replicate the intricate connectivity and synaptic interactions found in human brain tissue. The assay may not capture all aspects of neuronal communication and network dynamics.

4. **Response to Toxicants**: The sensitivity and response of LUHMES cells to toxicants may differ from that of mature human neurons. Factors such as receptor expression, ion channel activity, and metabolic responses can vary significantly between the in vitro model and actual human tissue.

5. **Lack of Systemic Factors**: The assay does not account for systemic factors such as blood-brain barrier interactions, immune responses, and hormonal influences that can affect neuronal function and toxicity in vivo.

The explanation of the quantification algorithm is minimal, and there is no mention of the number of cells imaged.","The NeuriTox assay (UKN4) employs high-content imaging to assess two main endpoints: neurite area (as a measure of neurite outgrowth) and cellular viability. The key steps of the analytical method are as follows:

1. **Cell Preparation**: LUHMES cells are differentiated into dopaminergic neurons and then plated in 96-well plates. After a 24-hour exposure to test compounds, the cells are stained with calcein-AM to mark viable cells and Hoechst H-33342 to identify all cells.

2. **Staining**: The cells are incubated with the staining solutions for 30 minutes at 37°C and 5% CO2. This dual staining allows for the identification of viable cells (calcein-AM) and the visualization of nuclei (Hoechst).

3. **Imaging**: The stained cells are imaged using a Cellomics Array Scan VTI high-content reader. Ten fields per well are captured, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the cell population.

4. **Quantification**: The quantification algorithm identifies nuclei in the Hoechst channel to determine cell count and neurite area in the calcein channel. The software uses predefined parameters to classify objects based on size, area, shape, and intensity. Neurite pixels are calculated by expanding the nuclear outlines to define a virtual cell soma area, ensuring accurate measurement of neurite outgrowth.

5. **Data Analysis**: The data from the imaging are processed to obtain quantitative measures of neurite area and cell viability. The analysis includes calculating the percentage of viable cells and comparing neurite area to control conditions.

Both endpoints (neurite area and viability) are measured in the same well under the same conditions, allowing for simultaneous assessment of the effects of compounds on both parameters. Approximately 10 fields per well are imaged, providing a robust dataset for analysis.

Overall, the method integrates cell viability and neurite outgrowth assessment in a single experimental setup, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of neurotoxic effects. The quantification process is automated, enhancing throughput and consistency in data collection. _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_",0.7122369157601187,0.3136737644672394,0.0873725414276123,0.1937330812215805
"Provide information on machine settings, analytical standards, data processing and normalization procedures. For imaging endpoints: provide detailed algorithm. This information should also be covered in an SOP, preferably in DB-ALM format (see link in 6.6).","Quantification of neurite outgrowth An automated microplate reading microscope (Array-ScanII HCS Reader, Cellomics, PA) equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera (resolution 1024 x 1024; run at 2 x 2 binning) was used for image acquisition. Ten fields per well were imaged. Images were recorded in 2 channels using a 20x objective and excitation/emission wavelengths of 365 ± 50/535 ± 45 to detect H-33342 in channel 1 and 474 ± 40/535 ± 45 to detect calcein in channel 2. In both channels, a fixed exposure time and an intensity histogram-derived threshold were used for object identification. Neurite pixels were identified using the following image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified as objects in channel 1 according to their size, area, shape, and intensity which were predefined on untreated cells using a machine-based learning algorithm, and manual selection of nuclei to be classified as intact. The nuclear outlines were expanded by 3.2 µm in each direction, to define a virtual cell soma area (VCSA) based on the following procedure: The average width of the cytoplasm ring (distance nucleus - cell membrane) of LUHMES cells was experimentally determined to be 2.3 µm. Size irregularities were not always due to growing neurites, as determined by combined F-actin/tubulin beta-III staining. To avoid scoring of false positive neurite areas, the exclusion ring (VCSA) was made bigger than the average cell size. Then, we used two control compounds (U0126 and bisindolylmaleimid I) to vary the expanded outlines from 0.6 to 4 µm. We found 3.2 µm to be optimal both to detect neurite growth over time and to identify reduced neurite growth with high sensitivity. All calcein-positive pixels of the field (beyond a given intensity threshold) were defined as viable cellular structures (VCSs). The threshold was dynamically determined for each field after flat field and background correction and intensity normalization to 512 gray values and was set to 12% of the maximal brightness (channel 63 of 512). The VCS defines the sum of all somata and neurites without their assignment to individual cells. In an automatic calculation, the VCSAs, defined in the H- 33342 channel, were used as filter in the calcein channel and subtracted from the VCS. The remaining pixels (VCS - VCSA) in the calcein channel were defined as neurite area. Quantification of individual viable cells by imaging For a quantitative assessment of viable cells, the same images used to assess neurite area were analysed using another image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified in channel 1 as objects according to their size, area, shape, and intensity. Nuclei of apoptotic cells with increased fluorescence were excluded. A VCSA was defined around each nucleus by expanding it by 0.3 µm into each direction. Calcein-AM staining, labelling live cells, was detected in channel 2. The algorithm quantified the calcein intensity in the VCSA areas. Cells having an average calcein signal intensity in the VCSAs below a predefined threshold were classified by the program as “not viable”. Valid nuclei with a positive calcein signal in their cognate VCSA were counted as viable cells. A positive calcein signal was based on measurements of the average intensity (normal cells: 1300 ± 115, threshold: < 50) and the total integrated intensity (normal cells: 186,000 ± 23,600, threshold < 1000) of cells.",Medium,"The answer provides detailed information on the machine settings, imaging endpoints, and algorithms used for image analysis, which partially addresses the question.

The use of the updated prediction model BMC25 Viability (V) / BMC25 Neurite Area (NA) ≥ 4 was validated by comparing classifications derived by the initial and the updated prediction model. The reason for updating the prediction model was that a decrease of 50% in neurite area and viability cannot always be achieved with our range of test concentrations. An effect of 25% is more often observed and came to similar results when applied (Delp et al., 2018).",Medium,"The answer provides some relevant information about the setup and testing of the prediction model, including the chemicals used and references to documentation. However, it lacks clarity and completeness in addressing all aspects of the question, such as the specific classifiers/statistical approaches used, how data in the opposite direction are handled, and whether different rules apply to two-sided predictions. The explanation of sensitivity/specificity is also incomplete.","The prediction model for the NeuriTox assay was established using a training set of chemicals that included the following compounds: colchicine, vincristine, and nocodazole as positive controls, and etoposide and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) as unspecific toxicants affecting general viability. The model also included unspecific toxicants such as cycloheximide and paraquat. The process is documented in publications by Stiegler et al. (2011) and Krug et al. (2013) _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_.

The prediction model has been applied to screen a library of 80 compounds from the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) and a subsequent evaluation of 120 compounds in a developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing battery _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_.

The prediction model is designed to assess both increases and decreases in neurite area while maintaining viability. Specifically, it uses a ratio of BMC25 Viability (V) to BMC25 Neurite Area (NA) to classify compounds as specifically neurotoxic if the ratio is greater than or equal to 4. This indicates that the model can handle data in both directions, but the interpretation of effects may differ based on the direction of the change _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_.

For the two-sided interpretation, different rules and characteristics may apply. A decrease in neurite area is interpreted as a potential neurotoxic effect, while an increase in viability may not necessarily indicate toxicity. The thresholds and performance characteristics for both sides may not be the same, as the model is primarily focused on detecting decreases in neurite area as a key indicator of neurotoxicity _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_.",0.8741843291311748,0.2591634690761566,0.25773561000823975,0.2614288032054901

Are there data of ‘historical controls’ over a longer time period?","Some background on the test performance is given in chapters 8.2/8.3 (prediction model). Several performance parameters for the test were obtained in several separate evaluation rounds. A first evaluation was done during the first publication of the model and its applications (Stiegler et al. 2011, Krueg et al. 2013). Here, a panel of well-selected positive and negative controls have been tested. Accordingly, the specificity was 100% and the sensitivity was > 90 %. In dedicated experiments, S/N ratios of > 20 and a z’ of > 0.5 have been determined. The compound narciclasine (run on each plate as positive control) was tested across 36 different test plates and 12 independent assay runs. The neurite area relative to the solvent control varied between 40% and 75% across all plates with a viability value constantly >90% (Delp et al. 2018). The test has been used in screening campaigns, and real-live performance data under broader screen conditions have been obtained. The different performance data need to be considered, when a compound is a hit in a screen, or whether it has been specifically evaluated in a hit follow-up or a mechanistic project. A first screen application has been the NTP80 screen (80 compounds provided by the US NTP). Data are published Delp et al. 2018. A second screen application has been the cross systems case study of the EU-ToxRisk project. The baseline variation is indicated in Krebs et al., 2020. Moreover, an overview is given for 19 compounds on the BMC/BMCL ratio as measure of readout certainty. A third screen was performed in the context of the EFSA DNT test battery evaluation with 120 compounds (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). From this screen the following performance indicators were obtained: A: Sensitivity: 100%  With NeuriTox as standalone assay in 17 `tool negatives´ tested (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). B: Specificity: 82.7%  With NeuriTox combined in a full DNT battery and a selected set of 27 positive compounds with evidence for DNT (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). C: Baseline variation (intra-experimental) Neurite outgrowth: 11.7 ± 4.5% Cell viability: 3.8 ± 3.5% D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) Neurite outgrowth: 15.3% Cell viability: 4.3% E: Variation of a positive control run on each (inter-experimental) Neurite outgrowth: 38.5% Definition of values C-E C: Baseline variation (intra-experimental) is the mean CV±SD of the CV of all replicates of the solvent control from each experiment across n>200 experiments. D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) is the variability across all independent experiments (n>200) after normalization based on the response of the lowest test concentration. It was assumed that the lowest test concentration does not affect any of the endpoints measured. E: Variation of a positive control run on each (inter-experimental) is the variability of the positive control across all independent experiments (n>40) after normalization. Example for a positive control that on average reduced the specific endpoint down to 40% (relative to solvent control) and a calculated variability of 50%: 0.5 x 40% = +/- 20%  The positive control with mean of 40% varies from 20% to 60%.",High,"The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the test method's performance parameters, including specificity, sensitivity, signal/noise ratio, z-factor, baseline variation, and inter-operator variations. It also references multiple studies and data sources, offering detailed information on how these parameters were determined. The inclusion of historical control data and performance indicators from various screening campaigns further supports the completeness and relevance of the response.","The NeuriTox assay has the following performance parameters:

**Strengths of the NeuriTox assay in a test battery:**
- It is a medium to high throughput method, allowing for the screening of multiple compounds efficiently.
- The assay specifically measures neurite outgrowth in CNS dopaminergic neurons, making it relevant for neurotoxicity assessments.
- It has shown high sensitivity to cytoskeletal toxicants and some signaling modifiers, which are critical for identifying neurotoxic effects _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_.

**Weaknesses:**
- The assay has not undergone formal validation through OECD guidelines, which may limit its acceptance in regulatory contexts.
- It may not capture all aspects of neurotoxicity covered by in vivo studies, as it focuses on specific endpoints related to neurite outgrowth and viability _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_.

**Comparison to similar tests:**
The NeuriTox assay has been shown to have a specificity of 82.7% and a sensitivity of 100% when used in a DNT battery, indicating strong performance compared to other assays that may not be as focused on dopaminergic neurons _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_.

**Gaps filled by the NeuriTox assay:**
The assay addresses the need for a specific test for CNS dopaminergic neurons, which is not covered by other assays that may focus on peripheral neurons. This specificity allows for better predictions of neurodevelopmental toxicity related to compounds affecting the central nervous system _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_.

### Summary
These publications collectively provide a robust foundation for understanding the NeuriTox assay, its methodology, and its applications in neurotoxicity testing. They cover various aspects, including the test system's characteristics, validation against other assays, and practical applications in screening for neurotoxicants.",0.7145514005693089,0.19830864667892456,0.08805007487535477,0.14414410293102264
"Indicate whether the test method has been or could be linked to an AOP (or several AOPs) and in which form (e.g. test of KE activation). Can the test method cover an AOP MIE/KE? Reference relevant AOP and if in AOP-wiki, refer to status.","Test method could be potentially linked to the following AOPs in AOPwiki: AOP 48 : Binding of agonists to ionotropic glutamate receptors in adult brain causes excitotoxicity that mediates neuronal cell death, contributing to learning and memory impairment. → Organ effects: Neurodegeneration, decreased neuronal network function → Organism effects: Impairment of learning and memory AOP 13: Chronic binding of antagonist to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) during brain development induces impairment of learning and memory abilities. → Organ effects: Decreased neuronal network function → Organism effects: Impairment of learning and memory AOP 3: Inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I of nigra-striatal neurons leads to parkinsonian motor deficits. → Organ effects: degeneration of DA neurons of nigrostriatal pathway AOP 42: Inhibition of Thyroperoxidase and Subsequent Adverse Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in Mammals → Adverse Outcome: Cognitive function decreased AOP 54: Inhibition of Na+/I- symporter (NIS) decreases TH synthesis leading to learning and memory deficits in children. → Organ effects: decreased neuronal network function → Organism effects: learning and memory deficits AOP 8: Upregulation of Thyroid Hormone Catabolism via Activation of Hepatic Nuclear Receptors, and Subsequent Adverse Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in Mammals. → Adverse Outcome: Altered neurodevelopment AOP 134: Sodium Iodide Symporter (NIS) Inhibition and Subsequent Adverse Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in Mammals. → Adverse Outcome: Cognitive function decreased",Medium,"The answer lists several AOPs that the test method could potentially be linked to, providing some details about the organ and organism effects. However, it lacks clarity on whether the test method specifically covers an AOP MIE/KE and does not reference the status of these AOPs in the AOP-wiki. The response is partially complete but lacks specific details and references required for a 'High' score.","The NeuriTox assay has the potential to be linked to several Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs). It could be utilized as a test for key event (KE) activation within these AOPs. Specifically, the assay assesses neurite outgrowth and cellular viability in dopaminergic neurons, which aligns with neurodevelopmental toxicity mechanisms.

Relevant AOPs linked to the NeuriTox assay include:

1. **AOP 3**: Inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I of nigra-striatal neurons leads to parkinsonian motor deficits. This AOP is relevant as the assay evaluates neurotoxic effects that could lead to similar outcomes.
2. **AOP 48**: Binding of agonists to ionotropic glutamate receptors in the adult brain causes excitotoxicity that mediates neuronal cell death, contributing to learning and memory impairment.
3. **AOP 13**: Chronic binding of antagonists to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) during brain development induces impairment of learning and memory abilities.
4. **AOP 42**: Inhibition of Thyroperoxidase and subsequent adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in mammals.

The NeuriTox assay could cover the AOPs' key events (KEs) related to neuronal development and function, particularly in assessing the impact of toxicants on neurite outgrowth and neuronal viability.

For more detailed information, these AOPs can be referenced in the AOP-wiki, where their status and specific details are documented. However, the exact status of these AOPs in the AOP-wiki is not provided in the context.

"Indicate/summarize information on mechanistic validation, e.g. by omics approaches or by use of endpoint specific controls (MCC; section 5.5). Has it been explored in how far the system reflects human biology, signaling, tissue organization relevant to the form of toxicity to be assessed (e.g. nigrostriatal neurons should contain dopamine, liver tests relevant to cholestasis may need to contain bile canalicular structures, etc.)?","a) LUHMES are dopaminergic, express DAT, TH. Are of human origin, form network b) Tubulin plays a major role in neurite outgrowth and if inhibited by colchicine/vincristine/nocodazole neurite outgrowth is reduced. If the Rho/Rock pathway is activated, neurite outgrowth is enhanced. c) A formal mechanistic validation has not been performed. Reversibility and protection/counterregulation by mechanistic compounds have been shown (Stiegler 2011; Krug AK). d) The test covers a fundamental neurodevelopmental process. In some contexts, this might be seen as a key event of an AOP (Smirnova 2014, Bal-Price 2015 (ISTNET))",Medium,"The answer provides some relevant information about the mechanistic validation, such as the dopaminergic nature of LUHMES cells and their relevance to human biology. It mentions the role of tubulin and the Rho/Rock pathway in neurite outgrowth, and references studies showing reversibility and protection by mechanistic compounds. However, it lacks a comprehensive exploration of how well the system reflects human biology and specific tissue organization relevant to the toxicity form being assessed. The mention of a lack of formal mechanistic validation further limits the completeness of the response.","The NeuriTox assay has not undergone formal mechanistic validation, but it has demonstrated some aspects of mechanistic evaluation. The assay utilizes endpoint-specific controls (MCC) to assess neurite growth inhibition and enhancement. For instance, narciclasine serves as a positive control for neurite growth inhibition, while HA-1077 and blebbistatin are used for neurite growth enhancement, indicating the assay's ability to reflect specific signaling pathways relevant to neurite outgrowth.

The LUHMES cells used in the assay are dopaminergic and express the dopamine transporter (DAT), which is crucial for modeling the central nervous system's dopaminergic neurons. This characteristic allows the assay to reflect human biology relevant to neurotoxicity, particularly in the context of parkinsonian motor deficits. The cells grow axons and neurites during differentiation and exhibit electrophysiological activity, further supporting their relevance to human neuronal function.

However, a formal mechanistic validation has not been performed, and while the assay covers fundamental neurodevelopmental processes, it does not yet have established sensitivity and specificity metrics due to a lack of reference compounds. The assay's design and the characteristics of LUHMES cells suggest that it can model certain aspects of human neurobiology, particularly in relation to dopaminergic signaling and toxicity assessment _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_.",0.7244523957702815,0.14983302354812622,0.05761632323265076,0.10553671419620514
