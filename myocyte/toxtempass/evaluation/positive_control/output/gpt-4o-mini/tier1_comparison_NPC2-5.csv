Please describe in no more than 200 words the following:,"The human developing central nervous system may be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of chemical agents than the adult brain. At present, due to the knowledge gap concerning hazard identification for human neurodevelopmental toxicity (DNT), there is an urgent need for testing and subsequent regulation of chemicals for their potential to interfere with the developing nervous system. Primary human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) cultivated as three-dimensional floating spheres are able to represent several key processes during brain development. In the neural progenitor cell migration and differentiation assay (NPC2-5), hNPCs are plated on an extracellular matrix, and migrate and differentiate out of the sphere core. Thereby the processes radial glia migration, migration of neurons and oligodendrocytes as well as differentiation into neurons and oligodendrocytes and neurite outgrowth can be studied. Those DNT-specific endpoints are studied in combination with general cell viability and cytotoxicity. Cell migration and differentiation are critical processes during brain development that, if disturbed, lead to alterations in brain development and may cause cognitive dysfunction. Currently, cortical NPC migration- and differentiation-related processes are some of the many processes, which are assessed in the OECD TG426 by neuropathological evaluation of certain brain regions as well as neurobehavioral tests. According to the readiness criteria as published by Bal-Price et al. (2018), the neural progenitor cell migration and differentiation assay obtained readiness scores between A and B depending on the endpoint.",Medium,"The answer provides a detailed description of the vulnerability of the developing central nervous system to chemical agents and the need for testing.

1. **Quality Criteria for Proliferating Cell Line:**
   - The primary human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) must be obtained from a commercial supplier (Lonza) and provided as cryopreserved 3D neurospheres.
   - The cells should originate from the human brain cortex of different gestational ages (GW16-19).

2. **Specifications for Material:**
   - Each vial should contain 1x10^6 hNPCs with a viability of at least 20% as provided by the supplier.
   - The cells must be characterized to express specific CNS neural stem cell and progenitor cell markers such as nestin, SRY-box 2 (SOX2), and Ki67.

   - The supplier must test the cells for:
     - Positive expression of TUBB3 (neuronal marker) and GFAP (astrocyte marker) after differentiation.
     - Freedom from HIV, HBV, and HCV.
     - Negative results in sterility tests and for mycoplasma contamination.
     - A cell count of 1.2x10^6 cells/mL.

4. **Functional Parameters:**
   - The hNPCs should demonstrate the ability to proliferate in response to growth factors (EGF and FGF) and differentiate into neurons and oligodendrocytes upon removal of these factors.
   - The cells should exhibit characteristic morphological changes and express differentiation markers (e.g., β-III-tubulin for neurons, O4 for oligodendrocytes).

5. **Control of Pluripotency:**
   - While the assay focuses on neural progenitor cells, the maintenance of pluripotency is not directly applicable as these cells are already specified for neural differentiation.

6. **Stability Over Passages:**
   - The cells should maintain their characteristics and functionality over multiple passages, with specific attention to the proliferative capacity and differentiation potential.
   - The recommended passage range for optimal performance is not explicitly defined but should be monitored for consistency in behavior.

7. **Quantitative Definitions for AC:**
   - Acceptance criteria for the initial cell population include:
     - Viability: ≥ 20%
     - Positive expression of differentiation markers post-differentiation.
     - Cell count: 1.2x10^6 cells/mL.
     - Freedom from contamination (mycoplasma, pathogens).

8. **Exclusion Criteria:**
   - Cells that do not meet the viability threshold or show contamination.
   - Cells that fail to express the required markers or demonstrate poor differentiation potential.

In the 3- to 4-week expansion period different donors can show differences in their proliferative capacity (spheres need longer, 3 instead of 4 weeks, to reach the acceptable minimum size of 0.2 – 0.5 µm). After the first mechanical dissociation, there are no observable or measurable inter-individual differences. Critical consumables The proliferation medium does not contain serum or serum replacement. The use of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is critical for sphere growth. FGF contains 1% bovine serum albumin and is thus prone to batch effects. Critical handling The thawing medium contains DMSO in a concentration that affects cell health which is why thawed cells should quickly be diluted in proliferation medium (30 mL of media for one vial of cells). It is recommended to add FGF into the proliferation medium directly before thawing. At the end of week two of the expansion period (see below), the spheres should be transferred to petri dishes coated with poly-(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly-Hema) to prevent cell attachment. Attached cells that are not differentiated can be gently detached using a 1000 µL pipet. To avoid repeated attachment, all cells should be transferred to a new poly-Hema coated petri dish. Medium containing FGF should not be stored longer than 1 week at 4°C. During the first two weeks, the medium should be removed using a 1000 µL pipet to keep the accidental removal of small spheres to a minimum. In addition, removed medium should be kept in a new petri dish under culture conditions until the next feeding day, to transfer accidentally removed spheres back to the culture. The neurospheres should be well distributed in the petri dish to prevent aggregation. This is especially important after mechanical dissociations. It is important to avoid frequent re-opening of the incubators, to ensure constant CO2 and temperature levels. Furthermore, the smallest vibrations can lead to aggregations of neurospheres.",Medium,"The answer provides some relevant information about variability in initial cells, critical consumables, and handling steps, such as the importance of EGF and FGF, and handling procedures to prevent cell attachment.

The thawing is performed by repeated addition and removal of proliferation medium to the vial until all cells are transferred to a tissue culture flask containing proliferation medium. The cells are carefully resuspended and distributed to 10 cm petri dishes filled with fresh, prewarmed proliferation medium. The cells are fed by replacing half the medium with new medium every two to three days (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). At each feeding day, the culture is checked for impurities (e.g. fibers or other debris). Impurities and the removed media are transferred to a new petri dish (waste dish). If spheres are mistakenly sorted out during feeding, they can be rescued and placed back in the original culture dish. After 3-4 weeks neurospheres reach the acceptable size of 0.2 – 0.5 mm for passaging by mechanical dissociation. Therefore, neurospheres are mechanically dissociated into pieces of 0.15 - 0.25 mm edge length (depending on the desired sphere size after passaging) using a tissue chopper, which then round-off again to uniform sized neurospheres within 1 day in proliferation medium. By using this method, neurospheres are expanded every week. Starting at week three poly-Hema-coated dishes are used for the cultivation procedure.

However, it lacks information on the percentage of contaminating cells, the percentage of each subpopulation in co-cultures, and whether specific chemicals show differential cytotoxicity for the cell sub-populations used. These omissions prevent a 'High' score.","The test system used in the neural progenitor cell migration and differentiation assay (NPC2-5) consists of primary human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) derived from the human cortex at gestational weeks 16-19. These cells are cultivated as three-dimensional floating spheres, which allows them to represent key processes during brain development, including migration and differentiation.

### General Features/Principles of the Culture Protocol:
1. **Cell Source and Culture**: hNPCs are provided as cryopreserved 3D neurospheres from a commercial supplier (Lonza). The cells are expanded in a proliferation medium that contains epidermal growth factor (EGF) and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) to promote growth. The medium is serum-free, which helps to minimize variability due to serum batch effects.

2. **Differentiation Steps**: After a 3-4 week expansion period, the neurospheres are transferred to a differentiation medium (N2) to initiate migration and differentiation. This medium consists of DMEM and Ham’s F12 at a ratio of 2:1, supplemented with 1% N2 and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. The cells are plated on poly-D-lysine/laminin coated plates to facilitate attachment and promote differentiation.

3. **3D Structuring**: The hNPCs are initially cultured as floating spheres, which allows for self-organization and mimics the in vivo environment of the developing brain. This 3D structure is critical for studying the migration and differentiation processes.

4. **Contamination and Subpopulations**: The culture is primarily composed of hNPCs, but there may be a small percentage of contaminating cells, such as astrocytes and other glial cells. The specific percentages of these subpopulations are not detailed in the provided context. However, it is noted that the differentiation process leads to the generation of neurons, oligodendrocytes, and radial glia, with the final composition being a mixed culture.

5. **Sensitivity to Cytotoxicity**: The different cell types within the culture may exhibit varying sensitivities to cytotoxicity. For instance, radial glia and astrocytes, which are more prevalent in the culture, may influence overall viability measures due to their higher representation. The context does not specify whether certain chemicals or classes of chemicals show differential cytotoxicity for the subpopulations used.

Overall, the NPC2-5 assay is designed to assess the effects of chemical exposure on the migration and differentiation of hNPCs, reflecting critical neurodevelopmental processes. The culture protocol emphasizes the importance of maintaining a 3D environment and using specific growth factors to promote the desired cellular behaviors.

The following parameters are considered important for assessing the quality of the cells:

1. **Spheres Size**: The spheres need to be rounded and have a size of 0.25 – 0.35 mm to be used in the test method.

2. **Cell Viability**: The basic neurosphere culture is checked for mycoplasma contamination every three months and controlled for fungal and bacterial contamination by visual inspection at each feeding and plating day. The acceptance criteria for cell viability is that the cells must have a viability of at least 20% as provided by the supplier (Lonza).

3. **Differentiation Markers**: After differentiation, the spheres should express specific markers. For example, the cells should test positive for β-III-tubulin (TUBB3) and GFAP after differentiation.

4. **Cell Count**: The cell count should be at least 1.2 x 10^6 cells/mL before shipment from the supplier.

5. **Contamination Testing**: Cells must be tested free of HIV, HBV, and HCV, and must be negative in sterility tests and for mycoplasma contamination.

The analytical methods used to evaluate the culture include:

- **Immunocytochemistry (ICC)**: This method is used to assess the expression of differentiation markers such as β-III-tubulin for neurons and O4 for oligodendrocytes after 120 hours of differentiation.

- **Cell Counting**: The number of Hoechst-positive nuclei is counted to determine cell density.

- **Viability Assays**: The Alamar blue assay is used to assess mitochondrial activity and cell viability.

The acceptance criteria for the test system at the end of compound exposure include:

- **Radial Glia Migration (72h)**: 700 – 1500 µm
- **Radial Glia Migration (120h)**: 700 – 1600 µm
- **Percentage of Neurons**: ≥ 1.5%
- **Percentage of Oligodendrocytes**: ≥ 1.5%
- **Cell Number**: 2500 – 6000 cells

If the acceptance criteria are not met, actions may include repeating the experiment, adjusting the culture conditions, or investigating potential issues with the cell source or handling procedures. Historical controls are maintained to assess the performance of the test system against these acceptance criteria, ensuring that the average and variation of the values for the acceptance criteria parameters are within acceptable limits based on previous experiments. 

Overall, these criteria and methods ensure that the cultures used in the NPC2-5 assay are of high quality and suitable for toxicity testing. _(Source: NPC2-5.pdf)_",0.6752028533091978,0.5749527215957642,-0.10515096038579941,0.14982791244983673

1. **Acceptance Criteria for Source Cells:**
   - The spheres need to be rounded and have a size of 0.25 – 0.35 mm to be used in the test method.
   - The basic neurosphere culture is checked for mycoplasma contamination every three months and controlled for fungal and bacterial contamination by visual inspection at each feeding and plating day.

2. **Acceptance Criteria for the Test System at the End of Compound Exposure:**
   - **Radial glia migration (72h):** 700 – 1500 µm
   - **Radial glia migration (120h):** 700 – 1600 µm
   - **Cell number:** 2500 – 6000
   - **Percentage of neurons:** ≥ 1.5%
   - **Percentage of oligodendrocytes:** ≥ 1.5%

3. **Variability and Historical Controls:**
   - The acceptance criteria are based on the mean response of at least three replicates of the solvent control (SC). The historical performance of the assay is monitored, and the variability is assessed through the coefficient of variation (CV) across multiple experiments. For example, if the average radial glia migration is consistently within the specified range across multiple runs, it indicates the reliability of the assay.

4. **Actions if Acceptance Criteria are Not Met:**
   - If the average neurite length is below the specified threshold (e.g., 25 µm), experiments are discarded.
   - If the percentage of neurons or oligodendrocytes falls below the acceptance criteria (e.g., < 1.5%), the results are considered invalid, and the experiment may need to be repeated.

These criteria ensure that the test system is functioning correctly and that the results obtained are reliable and reproducible. If the acceptance criteria are not met, further investigation into the experimental conditions and potential troubleshooting steps would be necessary to identify and rectify the issues.

The variability for the different endpoints is shown in 8.4 “Test Performance”.",Low,"The answer does not adequately address the question. It mentions sources of variation related to sphere selection and biological variability but fails to provide details on critical consumables, batch effects, handling steps, controls, expected values, or recommendations for reproducibility and performance.","In the neural progenitor cell migration and differentiation assay (NPC2-5), several factors contribute to variability in the final test system state:

### Known Causes of Variability:
1. **Selection of Spheres**: The size of selected spheres can differ based on the researcher and the availability of spheres.
2. **Biological Variability**: The primary human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) are a complex multicellular system, leading to inherent biological variability in migration and differentiation endpoints.

### Critical Consumables and Batch Effects:
- **Plate Format**: The use of poly-D-lysine/laminin coated plates is critical for cell migration and differentiation. Different plate types may require re-establishment of the test system.
- **Growth Factors**: The use of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is essential for sphere growth, and batch effects can occur due to variability in FGF, which contains 1% bovine serum albumin.

### Critical Handling Steps:
- **Thawing Cells**: Thawed cells should be quickly diluted in proliferation medium to minimize the impact of DMSO on cell health.
- **Medium Changes**: During the first two weeks, medium should be removed carefully to avoid accidental removal of small spheres.
- **Mechanical Dissociation**: Spheres should be mechanically dissociated into uniform sizes to ensure consistent growth and differentiation.

### Positive and Negative Controls:
- **Positive Controls**:
  - **Radial Glia Migration (NPC2a)**: SRC kinase inhibitor PP2 is used, with expected migration values between 0 and 60% of the solvent control.
  - **Neuronal Differentiation (NPC3)**: EGF is used, reducing neuronal differentiation to values between 0 and 50% of the solvent control.
  - **Oligodendrocyte Differentiation (NPC5)**: BMP7 is used, reducing oligodendrocyte differentiation to values between 0 and 60% of the solvent control.

- **Negative Controls**: Solvent control (SC) is used to assess the acceptability criteria for migration and differentiation.

### Accepted Deviations:
- **Radial Glia Migration (72h)**: 700 – 1500 µm
- **Radial Glia Migration (120h)**: 700 – 1600 µm
- **Neuronal Differentiation**: ≥1.5% neurons
- **Oligodendrocyte Differentiation**: ≥1.5% oligodendrocytes
- **Cell Number**: 2500 – 6000 cells

### Recommendations to Increase/Ensure Reproducibility and Performance:
1. **Automate Pipetting Steps**: Use a liquid handling system to reduce variability and user bias in pipetting.
2. **Standardize Cell Sourcing**: Ensure consistent sourcing of hNPCs from the same supplier and batch to minimize biological variability.
3. **Regular Quality Control**: Implement routine checks for mycoplasma contamination and visual inspection for impurities at each feeding and plating day.
4. **Careful Handling of Spheres**: Minimize mechanical stress during handling and ensure spheres are well distributed in culture dishes to prevent aggregation.
5. **Consistent Environmental Conditions**: Maintain stable CO2 and temperature levels in incubators and minimize frequent opening to prevent fluctuations.

By addressing these factors, the reproducibility and performance of the NPC2-5 assay can be enhanced, leading to more reliable results in assessing developmental neurotoxicity. _(Source: NPC2-5.pdf)_",0.7481149085965266,0.19289566576480865,-0.13934385776519775,0.005690686404705048

Give information on where the test system differs from the mimicked human tissue and which gaps of analogy need to be considered.,"hNPCs reflect the following in vivo tissue features: In differentiation culture: NPC2a – radial glia cell migration → corresponding to radial glia cell migration during corticogenesis in vivo. The migrated hNPCs exhibit the characteristic elongated radial glia (RG)-like morphology and express the RG-markers nestin and GFAP as well as the proliferation marker Ki-67 (Koch et al., 2022). In accordance with in vivo studies, exposure to EGF (0.5-1 ng/mL) after neurosphere plating enhances hNPC migration compared to the solvent control (Koch et al., 2022). As a second human-relevant key regulator of migration, hNPCs respond to SRC-family kinase inhibition (PP2) with reduced migration (Moors et al., 2007; Koch et al., 2022). The migration speed of hNPCs in vitro is in the same range as migrating mouse granule cells in vivo (Baumann et al., 2016, Fahrion et al., 2012). NPC2b – migration of young cortical neurons on radial glia scaffolds → corresponding to cortical neuronal radial migration. NPC2c – oligodendrocyte migration → corresponding to oligodendrocyte migration during corticogenesis. NPC3 – fetal neuronal differentiation into young neurons → corresponding to cortical neurogenesis in vivo. Over the time course of differentiation, neurons expressing β-III-tubulin progressively appear in the migration zone representing approximately 20% of the mixed culture after 5 days. In line with observations in vivo, inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway during hNPC differentiation increases neuronal numbers compared to the solvent control (Koch et al., 2022). Moreover, narciclasine, an activator of Ras homolog family member A (RhoA), reduces neuronal differentiation of hNPCs cultured for 5 days in a concentration-dependent manner (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020; Blum et al., 2023). Likewise, RhoA inactivation stimulated axon regeneration and recovery of hindlimb function after spinal cord injury in mice (Dergham et al., 2002). NPC4 – neurite length, neurite area of young primary fetal neurons → corresponding to axon/dendrite formation in vivo. During the 5 days of hNPC differentiation, neurite maturation is characterized by an elongation of neurites and an increase in neurite area (Koch et al., 2022). Increase in RhoA activity caused morphological alterations in rat cortical neurons in vivo (Chen et al., 2018). In line with that, RhoA activator narciclasine reduced both neurite area and neurite length (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020). NPC5 – oligodendrocyte formation from fetal hNPCs → corresponding to oligodendrogenesis during the fetal phase of brain development. Differentiation of hNPCs over 5 days progressively generates cells expressing the oligodendrocyte-marker O4, which exhibit the typical oligodendrocyte morphology with multiple branched processes necessary to ensheath neuronal axons (Moors et al., 2009; Koch et al., 2022). Differentiation of hNPCs in the presence of the Notch inhibitor DAPT concentration-dependently decreases the percentage of O4-positive cells compared to the solvent control (Koch et al., 2022). Moreover, oligodendrocyte differentiation is negatively influenced by bone morphogenic protein (BMP) 7 (Baumann et al., 2015) and BMP2 (Masjosthusmann et al., 2018), proteins of the transforming growth factor β family. These data demonstrate that two major developmental pathways, i.e. Notch and BMP, are functional in hNPCs. Primary hNPCs are self-organized and produce auto- and paracrine cues like heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) and neuregulins that guide migration and differentiation. Moreover, they express extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins like laminin subunits, fibronectin and collagens (microarray data from Klose et al. 2021). Hence, effects concerning ECM-like adhesion defects can be assessed with this assay (Barenys et al. 2017). Various signaling cues that guide migration and differentiation processes of the neurosphere assay are summarized in Koch et al., 2022.",Low,"The answer provides detailed information on the features and behaviors of hNPCs in vitro, but it does not address where the test system differs from the mimicked human tissue or identify specific gaps of analogy that need to be considered. The response lacks a direct comparison between the test system and human tissue, which is essential to fully address the question.","The neural progenitor cell migration and differentiation assay (NPC2-5) is based on primary human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) obtained from the human fetal cortex. While this assay effectively models several neurodevelopmental processes, there are notable differences and gaps in analogy compared to in vivo human tissue:

1. **Timing of Development**: The assay represents early processes of neurodevelopment during the fetal period. However, it does not study later processes such as synaptogenesis and neuronal network formation, which are critical for mature brain function.

2. **Cortical Layer Formation**: The assay mimics cortical radial glia and neuronal migration but does not replicate the complex process of cortical layer formation that occurs in vivo.

3. **Maturation of Neurons**: Neurons in the assay remain immature, which limits the ability to study later developmental stages and functional maturation that occurs in the developing brain.

4. **Cell-Cell Interactions**: Although the assay allows for some cell-cell interactions through a self-organized mixed culture system, it may not fully replicate the intricate signaling and interactions present in a fully developed brain.

5. **Environmental Factors**: The in vitro environment lacks the full range of biochemical and physical cues present in vivo, which can influence cell behavior and development.

These gaps highlight the need for caution when extrapolating results from the NPC2-5 assay to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes in humans, as the assay does not encompass all aspects of human brain development and function. Therefore, it is recommended that this assay be part of a broader test battery to assess developmental neurotoxicity comprehensively _(Source: NPC2-5.pdf)_.",0.8083133013757527,-0.024867234751582146,0.08827357739210129,0.03268135339021683

For imaging endpoints: Explain in general how quantification algorithm or how semi-quantitative estimates are obtained and how many cells are imaged (roughly).","Primary endpoints: 1 . Radial glia migration 72 h is assessed as migration distance in µm from the edge of the sphere core to the edge of the migration area based on brightfield images of each well (Figure 3). Therefore, each plate is scanned after 72 h in culture in an automated high content imaging device under 5% CO2 and 37°C. Images are exported and the sphere size in four directions is measured manually using ImageJ. All other primary endpoints are assessed based on an ICC staining image for each sphere. Therefore, cells are fixated after 120 h in culture and an ICC staining with Hoechst for nuclei, β-III-tubulin for neurons and O4 for oligodendrocytes is performed. The plates are scanned using an automated high content imaging device and all nuclei and their positions are determined automatically based on their intensity and size. Images are imported to the Omnisphero software (https://omnisphero.com) to run the image analysis that measures the following endpoints. 2 . Radial glia migration 120h is assessed as the migration distance in µm between the sphere core and the edge of the migration area based on ICC images of Hoechst-positive nuclei. By identification of each nuclei’s position in relation to the sphere core, the migration distance can be calculated. Therefore, a density distribution mask is calculated. By scanning the images of the nuclei channel, the algorithm can determine relatively more or less dense image areas. By identifying the densest area in the image, the sphere core can be detected. For identification of the migration, it is assumed, that the nuclei density decreases with increasing distance to the sphere core. Once the density hits a pre-defined threshold, the outer boundaries are determined and the sphere itself can be mapped out in a polynomial bounding box. Derived from this box, the actual size and migration distance can be calculated for each well. 3 . Neuronal migration 120 h is the mean distance of all neurons from the edge of the sphere core in relation to the radial glia migration and is determined based on the position of each neuron (see neuronal differentiation). 4 . Oligodendrocyte migration 120 h is the mean distance of all oligodendrocytes from the edge of the sphere core in relation to the radial glia migration and is determined based on the position of each oligodendrocytes (see oligodendrocyte differentiation). 5 . Neuronal differentiation is defined as the number of all β-III-tubulin-positive cells in percent of the cell number (Hoechst-positive cells) in the migration area after 120 h of differentiation. The identification of neurons is done automatically using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Training of the CNN was done based on manually annotated experiments (Förster et al., 2021). 6 . Neurite length 120 h is the mean length in µm of all neurons (see neuronal differentiation) that are identified by the skeletonization algorithm in Omnisphero (https://omnisphero.com). 7 . Neurite area 120 h is the mean area in pixels (without nuclei) of all neurons (see neuronal differentiation) that are identified by the skeletonization algorithm in Omnisphero (https://omnisphero.com). 8 . Oligodendrocyte differentiation 120 h is defined as the number of all O4-positive cells in percent of the cell number (Hoechst-positive cells) within the migration area after 120 h of differentiation. The identification of oligodendrocytes is done automatically using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Training of the CNN was done based on manually annotated experiments (Förster et al., 2021). Secondary endpoints: 3 . Cell number is the number of all Hoechst-positive nuclei detected within the area between the sphere core and the outer boundaries of the migration area (see radial glia migration 120 h). 4 . Cytotoxicity 72/120 h is assessed as membrane integrity by measuring the amount of LDH leaked from cells with damaged plasma membranes. LDH-dependent reduction of resazurin to resorufin is measured in the supernatant of each well as fluorescence of the reaction product resorufin (relative fluorescence unit) in a multiplate reader after 72/120 h of differentiation and compound treatment. 5 . Viability 120 h is assessed as mitochondrial activity by measuring the amount of resazurin reduced to fluorescent resorufin (relative fluorescence unit) in a multiplate reader in the last two hours of the 120 h differentiation and compound treatment period.",High,"The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the analytical methods used, detailing the key steps and principles involved in assessing various endpoints.

The explanation includes how different endpoints are measured, the use of automated imaging devices, and the software employed for analysis. The response is relevant, complete, and sufficient for reviewers to understand the methods without needing full procedural details.","The analytical methods used in the neural progenitor cell migration and differentiation assay (NPC2-5) involve several key steps to assess various endpoints related to neurodevelopmental toxicity. 

1. **Cell Fixation and Staining**: After a 120-hour exposure period, cells are fixed using a fixation solution. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) is then performed, where specific antibodies are used to stain for key markers: Hoechst for nuclei, β-III-tubulin for neurons, and O4 for oligodendrocytes. This allows for the identification and quantification of different cell types within the culture.

2. **Endpoint Measurement**: The assay measures multiple endpoints, including radial glia migration, neuronal migration, oligodendrocyte migration, neuronal differentiation, neurite length, neurite area, and oligodendrocyte differentiation. These measurements are typically conducted in the same well under the same conditions, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the effects of compounds on multiple neurodevelopmental processes simultaneously.

3. **Imaging and Quantification**: High-content imaging devices are used to capture images of the stained cells. The images are analyzed using automated software (Omnisphero) that employs algorithms to quantify the various endpoints. For instance, the software can determine the migration distance by analyzing the density distribution of nuclei in relation to the sphere core. The number of cells imaged can vary, but typically, a significant number of cells (thousands) are analyzed to ensure statistical relevance.

4. **Data Analysis**: The data obtained from the imaging is processed to calculate the mean values for each endpoint. This includes normalizing the data to solvent controls and applying statistical methods to assess the significance of the results.

Overall, the NPC2-5 assay integrates multiple endpoints into a single experimental setup, allowing for efficient and comprehensive evaluation of neurodevelopmental toxicity in a high-throughput format. The combination of fixation, staining, imaging, and automated analysis provides a robust framework for assessing the effects of chemical exposures on human neural progenitor cells.

Endpoint-specific control effects on NPC2a, NPC3 and NPC5 from n>40 experiments are shown in figure 4. The locations of the endpoint-specific controls on the experimental plate are shown in figure 5. 3. Radial glia migration 72 h: The endpoint-specific control for radial glia migration after 72 h is the SRC kinase inhibitor PP2. SRC family kinases represent one pathway that regulates radial glia migration of differentiating hNPCs (Moors et al., 2007). Inhibition of this pathway with PP2 (10 µM) causes a reduction of radial glia cell migration to values between 0 and 60 % of the solvent control. 4. Neuronal differentiation: The endpoint specific control for neuronal differentiation is EGF. EGF is a growth factor that stimulates radial glia proliferation and migration and inhibits neuronal differentiation (Ayuso-Sacido et al., 2010; Jenny Baumann et al., 2016). 20 ng/mL EGF reduces neuronal differentiation to values between 0 and 50% of the solvent control. 5. Oligodendrocyte differentiation: The endpoint specific control for oligodendrocyte differentiation is BMP7. BMP7 promotes the BMP signaling cascade which upregulates astroglia differentiation and maturation and inhibits oligodendrocyte formation (Jenny Baumann et al., 2016; Gross et al., 1996; Mabie et al., 1997). 100 ng/mL BMP7 reduces oligodendrocyte differentiation to values between 0 and 60 % of the SC.

The measurement of cytotoxicity and viability therefore always represents all cells within the migration area. Because of the higher percentage of GFAP-positive radial glia and astrocytes, these two cell types are overrepresented in the assessment of cytotoxicity and viability. The measure of cell viability assessed by the Alamar blue assay (mitochondrial reductase activity) strongly depends on the number of cells in the migration area. Therefore, a reduction in cell number either due to a reduced migration distance or a lower cell number in the migration area will lead to a reduction in the Alamar blue signal despite the cell viability is not necessarily affected (Figure 3 in Nimtz et al. 2019).

Give details of addition of test compounds to test systems (e.g. in which compartment of compartmentalized cultures, in which volume, before after or during medium change, etc.).","The method is set up for 8 test conditions including 7 compound concentrations and one SC. The test conditions are prepared in a serial dilution from the stock solution (Figure 5). Stock solutions are prepared by diluting the compound in the solvent (e.g. DMSO) in a concentration that allows the preparation of the highest test concentration without exceeding the highest acceptable solvent concentration (see 0). For DMSO the highest acceptable solvent concentration is 0.1% which means that the stock concentration needs to be at least 1000x higher than the highest test concentration. Stock solutions in non-sterile solvents (e.g. water or PBS) have to be sterile filtrated using a sterile syringe filter (diameter 0.2 µm). Adsorption to the filter needs to be considered. Stock solutions are aliquoted and stored at -20°C. A stock solution is not thawed more than three times. For the preparation of the test condition the stock solution is diluted to the highest test concentration (default 1:1000) in differentiation medium. All following dilutions are prepared by serial dilutions of the highest concentration in differentiation medium containing solvent (in the concentration of the highest test concentration). The default serial dilution is 1:3 which covers a concentration range from e.g. 20 µM to 27 nM (729-fold). Depending on the desired concentration range, the dilution can be changed to 1:2, 1:5, 1:10 or other. The SC is prepared by adding the solvent to differentiation media in the same concentration as the highest test concentration. 100 µL of the compound dilutions and the SC are added to a 96-well plate (Figure 4). The serial dilution can also be prepared directly in the 96 well plates. hNPCs are added to each well after a 15 to 30 min equilibration period at 37°C and 5 % CO2. To subtract the background fluorescence of the phenol red-containing medium, 4 wells with medium only (Background, medium without cells, Figure 5) are prepared for the viability and cytotoxicity assays.Figure 5 Plating Scheme. The solvent control depends on the solvent of the compound that is tested. 7 compound concentrations are plated in a serial dilution from lowest (left) to highest (right) concentration. Lysis control (4 replicates for each timepoint, 72h and 120h) and background control (4 replicates) are used for the viability and cytotoxicity assays.

The default serial dilution is typically set at 1:3, which covers a concentration range from, for example, 20 µM to 27 nM (729-fold). However, this dilution can be adjusted to 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, or other factors depending on the desired concentration range. 

For functional endpoints that may not provide a full concentration-response, the test concentration is defined based on the Benchmark Concentration (BMC) approach, which is used to determine the concentration associated with a specific change in response.

Coated plates should be stored at 4°C for no longer than 7 days. If different plate types are used, the test system and test method need to be re-established. - Outer wells have to be filled with H2O because of edge effects. - Automating the pipetting steps using a liquid handling system for coating, preparation of the plates, feeding of the plate, viability and cytotoxicity assays reduces the variability and the user bias. Sources of variation: - Pipetting steps: Each pipetting step is a source of variation. Especially in the viability and cytotoxicity assays where the volume pipetted determines the final readout. - ICC: The staining consists of multiple washing steps. As pipetting errors add up in each washing step, there is variation in the dilution of blocking solution and antibodies. - NPC differentiation: The biological variation between the differentiation of different NPC spheres cannot be controlled and can lead to variations in the endpoints neuronal and oligodendrocyte differentiation. Known Pitfalls: - Spill over from the lysis control wells to other wells can happen and needs to be controlled by the operator. It is important to completely empty the 3-day lysis control wells after they have been used and fill them with water, to avoid spill over during the last 2 days of the experiment. - Multiple washing steps in the ICC staining lead to added pipetting errors and may cause differences in the volume in each well.

"How are data normally handled to obtain the overall test result (e.g. concentration response fitting using model X, determination of EC50 by method Y, use of EC50 as final data)? How do you model your concentration response curve (e.g. LL.4 parameter fit) and which software do you use (e.g. GraphPad Prism, R, etc.)?

Can you give uncertainty for non-cytotoxicity or no-effect? How do you handle non-monotonic curve shapes or other curve features that are hard to describe with the usual mathematical fit model?","The data is normalized to the SC and re-normalized to the starting point of the curve. For the normalization to the SC each replicate data point is normalized to the median of the SC in the respective experiment. For the cytotoxicity assays the following normalization is used instead of the normalization to the SC. Here again each response value is normalized using the median of the lysis control and the median of the solvent control. lysis control − response normalized response = lysis control − solvent control The R package drc is used to calculate the optimal curve-fit for each experiment (https://github.com/iuf- duesseldorf/fritsche-lab-CRStats; Keßel et al. (pre-print at BioRxiv; doi: 10.1101/2022.10.18.512648). For calculations of curve fits and BMCs, the data from independent experiments is pooled (median of all replicate values for one concentration). Several non-linear models are run with the concentration response data of each endpoint and the Akaike´s information criterion is used to determine the best fit. For re-normalization of the data, the response value of the curves starting point is determined and used to re-normalize all response values. Therefore, each mean response value is divided by the starting point of the curve and multiplied by 100. For the re-normalized response values the curve fitting is repeated to produce the final concentration response curve. For deriving a reference point (RP) or point of departure (Pod) the Benchmark Concentration (BMC) approach, as recommended by the EFSA Scientific Committee (Hardy et al., 2017), is applied. The BMC approach makes use of all data points that define the fitted concentration response curve. Thereby, the BMC is defined as the concentration that is associated with a specific change in response, the Benchmark Response (BMR). The BMR is a value of effect size and should be defined as an effect size that is higher than the general variability of the measured endpoint. The BMR is therefore determined based on the variability of the respective endpoint. BMR for NPC2-5: Primary DNT specific endpoints of the test method are: radial glia migration 72 h (NPC2a) radial glia migration 120h (NPC2a) neuronal migration 120 h (NPC2b) oligodendrocyte migration 120h (NPC2c) BMR30 neuronal differentiation 120 h (NPC3) neurite length 120 h (NPC4) neurite area 120 h (NPC4) BMR10 BMR10 BMR30 BMR30 BMR30 BMR30 oligodendrocyte differentiation 120h (NPC5) BMR30 Secondary endpoints are: cell number 120 h BMR30 cytotoxicity 72 h BMR10 cytotoxicity 120 h BMR10 viability 120 h BMR30 Based on the BMR and the concentration response curve, the evaluation tool calculates the BMC, as well as upper and lower confidence limits (BMCU and BMCL respectively) based on the predict function in the R package drc. The predict function calculates the prediction bands around the concentration response curve based on the deviation between independent experiments and gives an estimation of the area that is expected to enclose 95% of future data points. The BMCL is thereby defined as the intersection of the lower band and the BMR while the BMCU is defined as the intersection of the upper band and the BMR. The confidence intervals are used to access the uncertainty of the BMC. If the BMCU is 1.5 times above the test range, the original BMCU is replaced by 1.5x the highest tested concentration.",High,"The answer comprehensively addresses the question by detailing the data handling process, including normalization and re-normalization methods, the use of the R package 'drc' for curve fitting, and the application of the BMC approach for deriving reference points.

The test system therefore measures adverse events in the young (fetal) developing brain. Thereby, the biological processes that are modeled are: 1. radial glia cell migration (NPC2a) 2. migration of young cortical neurons (NPC2b) 3. oligodendrocyte migration (NPC2c) 4. fetal neuronal differentiation into young neurons (NPC3) 5. neurite outgrowth of young fetal neurons (NPC4) 6. oligodendrocyte formation of fetal NPC (NPC5) The toxicological events that are modeled include events that impact the above-mentioned biological processes in any direction (increase or decrease). Thereby, neurodevelopmental processes represented by the NPC2-NPC5 assay are guided by a variety of pathways known to contribute to the respective processes in vivo as assessed by hNPC exposure to in vivo relevant signaling pathway modulators (summarized in Table13, Masjosthusmann et al. 2020; Koch et al., 2022). All the endpoints can be assessed in a high content format within one experiment due to the multi-cellularity and high developmental dynamic of the neurospheres. In addition, the strength of the system is that it allows KE-based assessment of human neurodevelopment without the need to perform species extrapolation. Moreover, the self-organized mixed culture system contains cell-cell interactions e.g. via gap junction channels as cells die when cell-cell communication is blocked by gap junction blockers (unpublished observations). Hence, the system is superior to single-cell 2D systems, since due to its nature it mimics a multitude of neurodevelopmental processes. One limitation of the hNPC model is the restricted timing. These endpoints represent early processes of neurodevelopment during the fetal period. Neurons stay immature hence later processes like synaptogenesis cannot be studied. Moreover, correct positioning, like one can study in vivo with cortical layering, cannot be studied here, since the assay mimics cortical radial glia and neuronal migration but does not cortical layer formation.

1. **Scientific Rationale**: The assay links test method data to relevant in vivo adverse outcomes by modeling key neurodevelopmental processes that are critical for proper brain development. Disruptions in these processes can lead to cognitive dysfunction and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The assay uses primary human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) to reflect the biological processes occurring in the developing human brain, thus providing a human-relevant model for assessing the effects of chemicals on neurodevelopment.

3. **Biological Processes Modeled**: The assay models several critical biological processes, including:
   - Radial glia migration (NPC2a)
   - Neuronal migration (NPC2b)
   - Oligodendrocyte migration (NPC2c)
   - Neuronal differentiation (NPC3)

What is a ‘hit’ if the test is used in screening mode (= hit definition, if different from above)?","Two prediction models (PM) are applied for the NPC2-5 assay. One PM for a downregulation (PM downregulation) and one PM for an upregulation (PM upregulation) in cell differentiation and migration. PM down regulation The PM uses hit definition based on comparison of the confidence intervals (CI) for the BMC of the DNT- specific endpoint (BMCs) and the unspecific endpoint (cytotoxicity/viability; BMCus). Thereby the following four hit classifications apply: “no hit” The compound is not defined as hit. “specific hit”: The compound is defined as hit and the CI’s do not overlap, meaning that the upper confidence limit of the specific endpoint (BMCUs) is lower than the lower confidence limit of the unspecific endpoint (BMCLus). The compound is defined as hit and the CI of the specific endpoint overlaps by less than or equal to 10% with the CI of the unspecific endpoint. The compound is defined as hit and the CI of the specific endpoint overlaps by more than 10% with the CI of the unspecific endpoints. “borderline hit”: “unspecific hit” The compound is classified as a hit, if the concentration response curve generates a BMC and if the CI is within the test range. In case the CI spans above the test range, the compound is only classified as hit, if the highest test concentration is significantly different from the lowest test concentration. The adjusted significance (p<0.05) is thereby determined using a Tukey HSD test. The decision process for the prediction model is described in the flow chart in Figure 11. Figure 11: Decision tree for the PM for downregulation applied for test method NPC2-5. Overview of the decisions leading to the classification of a compound in one of four categories: “no hit”, “specific hit”, “borderline hit” and “unspecific hit”. Specific consideration for the prediction model: In case no confidence limits are available for the unspecific endpoint because the BMR is not reached, the BMCLus is assumed to be the highest tested concentration. If the CI of the specific endpoint spans above the test range for a compound identified as “hit” based on statistical significance, expert judgement is applied to define, if the “hit” is specific or unspecific. Therefore, all datapoints of the unspecific and specific endpoint of the highest test concentration are compared. If these data points do not overlap, the compound is classified as “specific hit”, otherwise as “unspecific hit”. In general, BMCs based on the same BMR are compared (e.g. BMC30us vs BMC30s). In case the BMC30us is not available for an endpoint that allows the generation of a BMC10us, the BMC10us is used instead. If the classification of this comparison is “unspecific hit”, the compound will be flagged as “check manually“ as the BMC10us is lower than the BMC30us leading to a higher probability of a false classification. To avoid such false classification expert judgement is needed. Compounds can also be flagged as “check manually”, if the classification based on the viability is different from the classification based on the cytotoxicity and if the confidence interval is very wide (BMCU/BMCL > 25), which means a high uncertainty for the BMC estimation. In both cases expert judgement is needed to decide on the classification. The expert judgement is an individual decision process, that accounts for effect size, curve progression, statistical significance and overall standard deviation. If the concentration response curves do not give enough information for decision by expert judgement, additional testing or testing in a different concentration range should be performed. For compounds that reduce the cell number or radial glia migration the viability is not used as unspecific endpoint. The reason is that an effect in both endpoints indirectly affects cell viability. In this case only the cytotoxicity is used for the classification. PM upregulation In contrast to the PM for downregulation, the PM for upregulation is based on a hit definition without the comparison of confidence intervals (CI) between the specific and unspecific endpoint. The reason is that specific and unspecific endpoint do not have the same relationship during an induction compared to a reduction in the endpoint. A loss in general cell health will likely result in an effect in e.g cell migration or differentiation, while an induction in cell health (measured as mitochondrial activity) does not necessarily increase these endpoints. The following three hit classifications apply: “no hit” The compound is not defined as hit. “specific hit”: The compound is defined as hit and the effect is not an artifact due to loss in cell health. “unspecific hit” The compound is defined as hit in only the unspecific endpoints. The compound is classified as hit, if the concentration response curve generates a BMC and if the CI is within the test range. In case the CI spans above the test range, the compound is only classified as hit, if the highest test concentration is significantly different form the lowest test concentration. The adjusted significance (p<0.05) is thereby determined using a Tukey HSD test. The decision process for the prediction model is described in the flow chart in figure 7. Figure 7: Decision tree for the PM for upregulation applied for test method NPC2-5. Overview of the decisions leading to the classification of a compound in one of three categories: “no hit”, “specific hit”, and “unspecific hit”. In case a compound is classified as hit together with a reduction in an unspecific endpoint, it needs to be clarified if the induction is a specific effect or an artifact due to a loss in cell viability or an increase in cytotoxicity. Therefore, expert judgement is applied which accounts for effect size, curve progression, statistical significance, overall standard deviation but also morphological changes of the spheres. Expert judgement is additionally applied if the confidence interval is very wide (BMCU/BMCL > 25) which means a high uncertainty for the BMC estimation.",Medium,"The answer provides a detailed description of the prediction models for both downregulation and upregulation, including hit classifications and decision processes.

In the case of high uncertainty in the confidence interval, (e.g. because the CI spans above the tested concentration range) the model additionally considers the statistical significance between the highest and the lowest test concentration. Next to the hit definition the uncertainty given by the 95 % CI is also considered in the specificity analyses (see 8.2 for a more detailed description). The model has been tested on a set of 17 DNT negative- and 9 human DNT positive compounds (see 5.6 and 5.7). All negative compounds were correctly classified as “no hit” while 6 positive compounds were correctly classified as “specific hit”. Here it is important to mention, that it is not expected that the NPC2-5 assay identifies all DNT positive compounds as not all of those compounds act via the mode-of-action (MoA) represented by the NPC2-5 assay. For most compounds the exact MoA for their neurodevelopmental adversity is not precisely known, yet other mechanisms like synaptogenesis and neuronal network formation are amongst the known DNT MoAs.",Medium,"The answer provides some details about the prediction model setup, including the use of 95% confidence intervals and statistical significance for hit definition, and mentions the test set of chemicals (17 DNT negative and 9 human DNT positive compounds). However, it lacks clarity on the specific classifiers or statistical approaches used, does not address whether the process is documented in a publication, and does not fully explain how the model applies to changes on both sides of controls or how data in the opposite direction are handled. The answer is partially complete but lacks comprehensive details on several aspects of the question.","The prediction model (PM) for the NPC2-5 assay was set up using a test set of 9 predicted human developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) positive compounds and 17 predicted human DNT negative compounds. The performance parameters were determined based on this compound set, which included a total of 26 unique compounds tested. The PM is designed to classify compounds based on their effects on neurodevelopmental endpoints, with specific classifications for downregulation and upregulation effects.

The PM is two-sided, meaning it applies to changes in both directions (up and down). For downregulation, the model uses hit definitions based on comparisons of confidence intervals (CIs) for the specific DNT endpoints and unspecific endpoints (cytotoxicity/viability). The classifications include ""no hit,"" ""specific hit,"" ""borderline hit,"" and ""unspecific hit."" For upregulation, the model classifies compounds based on whether the effect is not an artifact due to loss in cell health.

The process of setting up and testing the prediction model is documented in publications, including Masjosthusmann et al. (2020) and Blum et al. (2023), which detail the establishment of the in vitro testing battery for assessing DNT hazard.

In summary, the PM is two-sided, allowing for the interpretation of both increases and decreases in viability or other endpoints as potential effects or toxicity, with specific rules and interpretations applied to each side. The thresholds and performance characteristics may differ between the two sides, reflecting the nature of the biological responses being measured.
