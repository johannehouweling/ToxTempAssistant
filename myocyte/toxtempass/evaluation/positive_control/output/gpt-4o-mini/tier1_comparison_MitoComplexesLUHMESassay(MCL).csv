1. **Confluency**: Cells should have a confluency of about 80% before seeding. This is assessed visually.

2. **Distribution**: Cells must be evenly distributed on the day of the assay, which is also determined through visual inspection.

3. **Contamination**: The cultures must not be contaminated, again verified through visual inspection.

4. **Oxygen Consumption Rate (OCR)**: After compound treatment, the negative controls should fulfill the following:
   - OCR must not change significantly in response to control injection.
   - Oxygen levels should start at approximately 150 mmHg for each measurement and must not drop below 60 mmHg.

These criteria ensure that the cells are healthy and suitable for the assay. If the acceptance criteria are not met, actions may include discarding the cell batch or repeating the experiment with a new batch of cells.

2. **Cell Distribution**: 
   - Cells must be evenly distributed on the day of the assay and should not show signs of contamination.

3. **Pathogen-Free Status**: 
   - Cells must be pathogen-free, with regular testing for mycoplasma after thawing.

4. **Morphology**: 
   - Cells should exhibit an oval morphology and should not form extensive aggregates or clustering. 

5. **Cell Death**: 
   - Approximately 5-10% of cell death (dead cells floating in the flask) is considered normal. Increased cell death one passage after thawing justifies discarding the cell batch.

6. **Culture Medium Color**: 
   - The culture medium should not be yellow, indicating proper cell health.

7. **Passage Number**: 
   - Proliferating cells from working stock batches should only be used up to passage 18.

Recommendations for reproducibility are implied but not explicitly stated, leading to a partial and somewhat unclear response.","The known causes of variability for the final test system state in the MitoComplexesLUHMES assay (MCL) include:

1. **Critical Consumables and Batch Effects:**
   - Problems with coating (different PLO/fibronectin batches; problems with water quality) can lead to variability. It is recommended to wash twice after coating and use PBS instead of MilliQ-H2O if issues arise.
   - Different cell passages can affect morphology and behavior; thawing a new batch may be necessary.
   - Variability can also arise from different lots of medium and supplements, as well as plastic ware obtained from different suppliers.

2. **Critical Handling Steps and Influencing Factors:**
   - Cells should be handled quickly to minimize time at room temperature, especially during seeding and medium changes.
   - Care should be taken during pipetting to ensure minimal variance; highly trained/automated handling is necessary.
   - The confluency of cells should be maintained between 40-90%, as too little or too high cell density can impair metabolism and differentiation.

3. **Positive and Negative Controls:**
   - **Negative Control:** Solvent (0.1% DMSO final concentration) and MG132 (100 nM). The expected outcome is that OCR must not change significantly in response to control injection.
   - **Positive Controls:** Specific inhibitors for each mitochondrial complex (e.g., 0.5 µM rotenone for cI, 5 mM malonate for cII, 0.5 µM antimycin A for cIII, sodium azide for cIV) should show expected inhibition of OCR.

4. **Accepted Deviation:**
   - The acceptance criteria for the test system at the end of compound exposure include that oxygen levels should start at approximately 150 mmHg and must not drop below 60 mmHg. The negative controls should not show significant changes in OCR.

5. **Recommendations to Increase/Ensure Reproducibility and Performance:**
   - Regularly check and maintain the quality of consumables, including cell culture media and plastic ware.
   - Ensure consistent cell passage numbers and avoid using cells beyond passage 20.
   - Implement strict protocols for handling and processing cells to minimize variability.
   - Use standardized procedures for coating plates and preparing reagents to ensure consistency across experiments.
   - Document all experimental conditions meticulously to identify and control for potential sources of variability.

The key principles of the analytical methods used in this assay include measuring the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) to evaluate mitochondrial function and the specific inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complexes.

### Key Steps of the Method:
1. **Cell Preparation**: LUHMES cells are cultured and differentiated into dopaminergic neurons. They are seeded into coated Seahorse XFe24-well plates at a density of 60,000 cells per well one day prior to the experiment.

2. **Permeabilization**: Just before the assay, the culture medium is replaced with a MAS buffer containing ADP and digitonin to permeabilize the cells, allowing access to the mitochondrial complexes.

3. **Baseline Measurement**: The basal OCR is recorded before the injection of the test compounds.

4. **Compound Injection**: A sequence of specific substrates and inhibitors for the mitochondrial complexes (cI, cII, cIII, cIV) is injected to determine their activity. The OCR is measured after each injection to assess the impact of the compounds on mitochondrial function.

5. **Data Normalization**: All OCR measurements are normalized to the respective basal OCR to calculate the activity of each complex as a percentage of control.

### Endpoint Measurement:
The assay focuses on measuring the activity of four mitochondrial complexes (cI, cII, cIII, cIV) independently. Each complex's activity is assessed through a tiered approach, where specific substrates and inhibitors are added sequentially to determine the activity of each complex.

### Imaging and Quantification:
The assay does not involve imaging endpoints or quantification of cell morphology or neurite outgrowth within the same wells. Instead, it focuses solely on the OCR measurements to evaluate mitochondrial function. Therefore, there is no imaging algorithm or semi-quantitative estimates involved in this assay.

Additionally, the oxygen levels should start at approximately 150 mmHg for each measurement and must not drop below 60 mmHg after compound treatment _(Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf)_.

The rationale for using DMSO as a negative control is to ensure that any observed effects on mitochondrial complex activity can be attributed to the test compounds rather than the solvent itself.

The explanation of the estimate is not fully addressed, and the answer could be more concise and focused on the specific question asked.","The MitoComplexesLUHMES assay (MCL) can generate 192 data points per month. This estimate is based on the following calculations: 

- The assay allows for 6 conditions to be assessed per plate set, with each condition representing a different compound or concentration.
- Two plate sets can be run per day, leading to 12 data points per day (6 data points per plate set).
- Over a typical work schedule of 4 days of readout per week, this results in 48 data points per week.
- Multiplying by 4 weeks in a month gives a total of 192 data points per month.

Regarding the possibility of repeated measures from the same dish, the assay does not specify the extent of repeated measures over time. Therefore, the ability to perform repeated measures would depend on the specific experimental design and the stability of the cell culture over time. However, the assay is designed to assess the activity of mitochondrial complexes at a single time point after compound exposure, which typically does not involve repeated measures from the same dish. 

Thus, while the assay can generate a significant number of data points, the potential for repeated measures is not explicitly detailed in the provided context.

It also does not specify the human adverse outcomes or hazards predicted by the test method.","The MitoComplexesLUHMES assay (MCL) is designed to assess the impairment of mitochondrial complex activity in human dopaminergic neurons, which is relevant for predicting neurotoxicity. The scientific rationale for linking test method data to in vivo adverse outcomes lies in the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly those affecting dopaminergic neurons, such as Parkinson's disease.

The assay models the following toxicological targets:
- **Organ/Tissue:** Central nervous system, specifically dopaminergic neurons.
- **Physiological/Biochemical Function:** Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex activity.

The biological processes reflected by the test method include:
- **Neurite Outgrowth:** The assay indirectly assesses the health and functionality of neurons, which is critical for neurite outgrowth.
- **Differentiation:** The LUHMES cells are differentiated into mature dopaminergic neurons, allowing the assessment of mitochondrial function in a relevant cell type.

The toxicological events modeled by the assay include:
- **Oxidative Stress:** Mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to increased oxidative stress, which is a common pathway in neurotoxicity.
- **Cell Death:** The assay is sensitive to toxicants that can induce cell death, as indicated by the measurement of mitochondrial activity.

The adverse outcomes related to the test method include:
- **Neurodegeneration:** Impairment of mitochondrial function in dopaminergic neurons can lead to neurodegenerative conditions.
- **Functional Impairment of Neurons:** The assay predicts potential functional impairments that could result from mitochondrial toxicants.

The hazards that the MitoComplexesLUHMES assay potentially predicts include:
- **Mitochondrial Toxicity:** The assay is sensitive to compounds that inhibit mitochondrial complex activity, which can lead to neurotoxic effects.
- **Neurotoxicity:** It provides insights into the potential neurotoxic effects of compounds based on their impact on mitochondrial function in dopaminergic neurons _(Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf)_.",0.7847965927951126,0.2228948175907135,-0.1390674114227295,0.01649331860244274

It is sensitive to mitochondrial complex inhibitors and provides mechanistic information, making it a valuable tool for screening potential neurotoxicants. 

**Strengths:**
- The assay serves as a good screening method for identifying compounds that impair mitochondrial function, which is a key event in neurotoxicity.
- It allows for internal controls to exclude artifacts easily, enhancing the reliability of results.
- The assay can provide mechanistic insights into how compounds affect mitochondrial activity, which is crucial for understanding their neurotoxic potential.

**Weaknesses:**
- The assay has not undergone formal validation or ring trials, which may limit its acceptance in regulatory contexts.
- It predicts some aspects of neurotoxicity but does not cover all aspects addressed by in vivo neurotoxicity studies (TG424), indicating that it may not provide a complete picture of neurotoxic effects.

**Comparison to Similar Tests:**
The MCL assay is similar to other assays that assess mitochondrial function and neurotoxicity, such as the Seahorse MitoStress Test. However, the MCL assay specifically focuses on the activity of individual mitochondrial complexes, which may provide more detailed mechanistic insights compared to broader assessments of mitochondrial function.

**Gaps Filled:**
The MCL assay fills a gap in the test battery by providing a specific focus on mitochondrial complex activity in human dopaminergic neurons, which is particularly relevant for neurotoxicants that target mitochondrial function. 

**Tier Usage:**
The assay is best suited for use in the first tier of testing due to its ability to screen for mitochondrial toxicity early in the assessment process. However, complementary assays may be required to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of neurotoxicity, particularly for compounds that may have effects beyond mitochondrial impairment.

Overall, while the MCL assay is a valuable addition to a test battery for neurotoxicity assessment, it should be used in conjunction with other assays to ensure a thorough evaluation of potential neurotoxic effects _(Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf)_.",0.41590362906560274,0.34107279777526855,-0.34815606474876404,-0.11026453226804733
