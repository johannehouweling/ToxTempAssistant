In the middle of the well is a silicone stopper that prevents cells from settling in a circular area in the middle of the well. The cells are kept viable and alive by the presence of EGF and FGF in the medium, and they become adherent overnight. When the stopper is removed, the cells form a dense monolayer in the culture dish, with a sharply demarcated circular area in the middle that is free of cells. Due to their natural spontaneous migration behaviour, the cells move into the cell-free area. The cells are still in a proliferative state. Proliferation at the edge of the cell free area contributes to a small extent to “apparent migration behaviour”. This has been characterized and quantified in detail (Nyffeler et al. 2016). It is accounted for by counting cells in a narrower circle than the original circular area.",Medium,"The answer provides a detailed description of the test system, including the culture protocol and cell behavior. However, it lacks information on the percentage of contaminating cells, the percentage of each subpopulation in co-cultures, and whether specific chemicals show differential cytotoxicity for the cell sub-populations used. These omissions prevent a 'High' score.","The test system used in the cMINC assay involves human neural crest cells (NCCs) generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The generation of the test system includes differentiation steps, which are detailed in the context provided.

### General Features/Principles of the Culture Protocol:
1. **Differentiation Steps**: NCCs are differentiated from the human iPSC line IMR90_clone_#4 following a modified protocol. The iPSCs are plated on Matrigel-coated plates and treated with specific media and growth factors to induce differentiation into NCCs over a period of approximately 35-39 days. The differentiation involves several media changes and the addition of growth factors such as EGF and FGF to support cell viability and proliferation during the process _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_.

2. **Culture Conditions**: The NCCs are maintained in a highly homogeneous pre-differentiated population. They are cultured in essential 8 (E8) medium on Laminin-521 coating, and the cells are split weekly to maintain their pluripotency characteristics _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_.

3. **Cell Viability and Contamination**: The acceptance criteria for the source cell population require that the cells be pathogen-free, with regular testing for mycoplasma. The cells must also express pluripotency markers (Oct4, Nanog, Tra-1-60) to confirm their viability and functionality _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_.

### Contaminating Cells and Subpopulations:
- The document does not specify the exact percentage of contaminating cells or the composition of subpopulations in co-cultures. However, it emphasizes that the derived NCCs are ≥ 90% positive for NCC markers, indicating a high level of purity in the cell population used for the assay _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_.

### Sensitivity to Cytotoxicity:
- The context does not provide specific information on whether certain subpopulations are more sensitive to cytotoxicity than others or if this could influence viability measures. Additionally, there is no mention of known differential cytotoxicity of specific chemicals or chemical classes for the cell sub-populations used in the assay _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_.

In summary, the cMINC assay utilizes a well-defined culture protocol for NCCs derived from iPSCs, with a focus on maintaining cell viability and purity.

However, it lacks detailed acceptance criteria, specific analytical methods, and historical control data. It also does not specify actions if acceptance criteria are not met.","The acceptance criteria for the cMINC assay at the start of toxicity testing include several endpoints to ensure that the cultures are as expected. These criteria focus on cell viability, differentiation, and expression of specific markers.

1. **Endpoints for Quality Control:**
   - **Cell Viability:** After thawing, the viability of the cells should be greater than 90%.
   - **Differentiation Markers:** The derived neural crest cells (NCCs) must be ≥ 90% positive for the NCC marker human natural killer-1 (HNK1) and the nerve growth factor receptor p75. Additionally, cells should express the stem cell microfilament protein nestin and AP2.
   - **Pathogen-Free Status:** Cells must be pathogen-free, verified through regular testing for mycoplasma.

2. **Analytical Methods:**
   - **Immunocytochemistry:** Used to assess the expression of pluripotency markers (Oct4, Nanog, Tra-1-60) and NCC markers (HNK1, p75).
   - **Cell Viability Assays:** Viability is measured using calcein-AM and Hoechst staining, followed by imaging and quantification.
   - **Morphological Assessment:** The typical mesenchymal-like cell morphology of NCCs is evaluated.

3. **Acceptance Criteria Values:**
   - **Viability:** > 90% of cells must be viable.
   - **Marker Expression:** > 90% of cells must express the NCC markers HNK1 and p75.
   - **Morphology:** Cells should exhibit typical NCC morphology.

4. **Historical Controls:**
   - The performance of the test system regarding acceptance criteria is monitored across multiple differentiation runs. For example, if differentiation is performed 10 times, the average viability and marker expression should consistently meet the specified thresholds, with acceptable variation (e.g., within ±5% for viability and marker expression).

5. **Actions if Acceptance Criteria are Not Met:**
   - If cell viability is below 90%, the cells should be discarded and a new batch should be prepared.
   - If the expression of NCC markers is below 90%, the differentiation process may need to be optimized, or the cells should be discarded.
   - Regular monitoring and adjustments in the culture conditions may be necessary to maintain the quality of the cell cultures.

These criteria and methods ensure that the cultures used in the cMINC assay are of high quality and suitable for assessing the effects of toxicants on NCC migration. _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_",0.6964507085343871,0.31735917925834656,0.10873597115278244,0.2077939361333847

It provides minimal information about acceptance criteria, focusing only on cell migration and viability, without discussing endpoints, parameters, historical controls, or actions if criteria are not met. It lacks detail and completeness required to fully address the question.","The acceptance criteria for the cMINC assay test system focus on the quality of the neural crest cells (NCCs) used in the assay. The following parameters are critical for assessing the quality of the cells:

1. **Cell Viability**: After thawing, the viability of the NCCs should be greater than 90%. This is essential to ensure that the cells are healthy and capable of responding to the assay conditions.

2. **Differentiation Markers**: The derived NCCs must be ≥ 90% positive for the NCC markers human natural killer-1 (HNK1) and the nerve growth factor receptor p75. Additionally, the cells should express the stem cell microfilament protein nestin and AP2, while showing no expression of astrocyte marker GFAP, central nervous system precursor cell marker Pax6, or neuronal marker βIII tubulin.

3. **Pathogen-Free Status**: The cells must be pathogen-free, with regular testing for mycoplasma to ensure that no contamination affects the assay results.

4. **Confluency**: During differentiation, the cells should reach a confluency of 80-100% before the differentiation process is initiated.

5. **Acceptance Criteria for Migration and Viability**: After compound treatment, the negative controls should fulfill the following:
   - Cells should migrate into the cell-free area.
   - Cell viability should remain above 90%.

If these acceptance criteria are not met, the following actions are taken:
- If the viability is below 90%, the cells are discarded and not used in further experiments.
- If the NCCs do not meet the differentiation marker criteria, they are also discarded.
- Experiments are discarded if the positive control does not inhibit migration (i.e., if the cell number in the migration zone is ≥ 75% of control) or if the negative control decreases migration by ≥ 10%.

Historical controls indicate that the assay has been performed multiple times, and the average values for the acceptance criteria parameters are monitored to ensure consistency and reliability in the results. If the average values fall below the established thresholds, it may indicate a need for troubleshooting or adjustments in the cell culture and differentiation protocols. 

Overall, maintaining strict adherence to these acceptance criteria is crucial for the reliability and validity of the cMINC assay results _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_.",0.6024122370727595,0.48404890298843384,-0.16266775131225586,0.07955973595380783

However, it lacks details on critical consumables, batch effects, specific handling steps, controls, expected values, and recommendations for reproducibility and performance.","Known causes of variability for the final test system state in the cMINC assay include:

1. **High Passage Number**: Maintenance of iPSCs at high passage numbers may influence NCC differentiation.
2. **Cell Density**: Too low or too high cell density at the start of differentiation can lead to issues such as detachment of cells or spontaneous differentiation.
3. **Handling of Cells**: Fast handling during freeze and thaw processes is crucial to avoid prolonged exposure to DMSO, which can decrease the number of viable cells after thawing.
4. **Batch Effects**: Variability can arise from critical additives, such as holo-transferrin for iron supply or TGF-β, which can lead to differentiation of cells at low passage numbers.

**Critical Consumables**:
- **Cell Culture Plates**: The format and supplier of the plates can affect results.
- **Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) or Serum Replacement**: Batch effects from these consumables can influence cell behavior.

**Critical Handling Steps**:
- **Pipetting**: Care is needed to ensure that substances are added correctly; for instance, substances should be added when pipette tips are just above the medium surface to ensure proper mixing.
- **Timeliness**: Steps such as cell seeding and medium changes should be performed quickly to minimize the time cells are at room temperature.

**Positive and Negative Controls**:
- **Positive Control**: Cytochalasin D (200 nM), which should inhibit migration significantly.
- **Negative Control**: Solvent (0.1% DMSO final concentration), which should show no inhibition of migration.

**Expected Values**:
- For positive controls, migration should be significantly reduced (e.g., cell number in the migration zone should be ≤ 25% of control).
- For negative controls, cells should migrate into the cell-free area, and cell viability should be > 90%.

**Accepted Deviation**:
- A test is discarded if the positive control does not inhibit migration (i.e., if the cell number in the migration zone is ≥ 75% of control).
- If the negative control decreases migration by ≥ 10%, the test is also discarded.

**Recommendations to Increase/Ensure Reproducibility and Performance**:
- Maintain consistent cell passage numbers and avoid high passage numbers.
- Ensure proper cell density during differentiation.
- Handle cells quickly during critical steps to minimize variability.
- Regularly test and validate the quality of critical consumables.
- Use standardized protocols for pipetting and handling to reduce human error.
- Implement rigorous training for operators to ensure consistency in handling and execution of the assay.

The key principles of the analytical methods used in this assay include:

1. **Cell Migration Measurement**: NCCs are plated around silicone stoppers in a culture dish, which creates a cell-free area in the center. Upon removal of the stoppers, the cells migrate into this area. The number of migrated cells is quantified 24 hours after toxicant treatment.

2. **Cell Viability Assessment**: Cell viability is measured using fluorescent dyes, specifically calcein-AM and Hoechst (H-33342). Viable cells fluoresce due to calcein-AM, while Hoechst stains the nuclei, allowing for the identification of live cells.

### Key Steps of the Method:
- **Cell Preparation**: NCCs are differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and maintained in culture.
- **Plating**: Cells are seeded around silicone stoppers in a 96-well plate and allowed to adhere overnight.
- **Migration Induction**: The silicone stoppers are removed, and the cells are allowed to migrate into the cell-free area.
- **Toxicant Treatment**: After 24 hours, toxicants are added to the wells, and the cells are incubated for an additional 24 hours.
- **Staining**: Cells are stained with calcein-AM and Hoechst for 30 minutes before imaging.
- **Imaging**: High content imaging is performed using an automated microscope, capturing images of the migration zone and surrounding areas.

### Measurement of Endpoints:
Both migration and viability are measured in the same well under the same conditions. The quantification of migration is based on the number of cells that have migrated into the cell-free area, while viability is assessed in the same well but outside the migration zone.

### Quantification Algorithm:
The quantification of migration involves imaging the center of the well in four tiles with a 5x objective. The images are stitched together to create a composite image of the migration zone. A software tool developed for this assay estimates the previously cell-free area and counts the number of double-positive cells (H-33342 and calcein) in the region of interest (ROI). Typically, the diameter of the ROI is chosen to contain 150 to 300 cells in untreated conditions, ensuring a robust analysis of both endpoints.

In summary, the cMINC assay integrates the measurement of cell migration and viability in a single experimental setup, utilizing high content imaging and automated analysis to provide quantitative data on the effects of toxicants on NCCs.",0.8115798405040716,0.3502269387245178,0.21445241570472717,0.2818470895290375

The compound used as positive control cytochalasin D was run across 35 different assay plates. The migration percentage relative to the solvent control varied between 30 and 70% across all plates (Nyffeler et al. 2016, Supplementary S2). Later, the test has been used in screening campaigns, and real-live performance data under broader screen conditions have been obtained. The different performance data need to be considered, when a compound is a hit in a screen, or whether it has been specifically evaluated in a hit follow-up or a mechanistic project. A first screen application has been the NTP80 screen (80 compounds provided by the US NTP). Data are published in Nyffeler et al. 2017. A second screen application has been the cross systems case study of the EU-ToxRisk project. The baseline variation is indicated in Krebs et al., 2020. Moreover, an overview is given for 19 compounds on the BMC/BMCL ratio as measure of readout certainty. A third screen was performed in the context of the EFSA DNT test battery evaluation with 120 compounds (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). From this screen the following performance indicators were obtained: A: Specificity of DNT IVB: 100% → Also with cMINC as standalone assay in 17 `tool negatives´ tested (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). B: Sensitivity of DNT IVB: 82.7% → With cMINC combined in a full DNT battery and a selected set of 27 positive compounds with evidence for DNT (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). C: Baseline variation (intra-experimental) Migration: 14.8 ± 4.3% Cell viability: 6 ± 3% D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) Migration: 15.6% Cell viability: 9.7% E: Variation of a positive control run on each (inter-experimental) Migration: 32.2% Definition of values C-E C: Baseline variation (intra-experimental) is the mean coefficient of variation CV±SD of the CV of all replicates of the solvent control from each experiment across n>200 experiments. D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) is the variability across all independent experiments (n>200) after normalization based on the response of the lowest test concentration. It was assumed that the lowest test concentration does not affect any of the endpoints measured. E: Variation of a positive control run on each (inter-experimental) is the variability of the positive control across all independent experiments (n>40) after normalization. Example for a positive control that on average reduced the specific endpoint down to 40% (relative to solvent control) and a calculated variability of 50%: 0.5 x 40% = +/- 20% → The positive control with mean of 40% varies from 20% to 60%.",High,"The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the test method's performance parameters, including specificity, sensitivity, signal/noise ratio, z-factor, baseline variation, and inter-operator variations.
