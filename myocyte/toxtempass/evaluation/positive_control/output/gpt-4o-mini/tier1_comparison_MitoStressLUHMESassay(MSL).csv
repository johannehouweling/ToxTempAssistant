2. **Functional Parameters:**
   - Cells should express specific marker genes relevant to their dopaminergic phenotype, such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH).
   - Cells should demonstrate the ability to extend neurites after differentiation and show electrical activity after 6 days of differentiation.
   - The cells should maintain their ability to respond to differentiation signals (e.g., tetracycline, GDNF, db-cAMP).

3. **Passage Stability:**
   - Proliferating cells from working stock batches should only be used up to passage 18. Cells are cultured until passage 20-25, but for experimental use, passage numbers should not exceed 18 to ensure stability and functionality.

4. **Exclusion Criteria:**
   - Cells that show signs of contamination or deviate from the expected morphology should be excluded.
   - Cells that exhibit excessive clumping or aggregation are also considered unsuitable for use.

5. **Additional Requirements for Genetically-Modified Cells:**
   - The cells must be maintained in S1 cell culture laboratories due to their genetically modified nature.
   - No specific ethical approval is required for the use of these cells, but they must comply with all safety regulations.

The cells undergo a differentiation process to become mature dopamine-like neurons. This differentiation is initiated by the absence of the cytokine basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and the addition of tetracycline, GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor), and db-cAMP for 6 days. The cells are typically cultured in a 2D monolayer but can also form 3D structures (Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf).

In terms of the culture protocol, LUHMES cells are seeded in proliferation medium and then switched to differentiation medium. The cells are maintained in proliferation medium and passaged every 2-3 days, with a minimum confluence of 40% and a maximum of 85% (Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf). 

Regarding contamination, the cells must be pathogen-free, and regular testing for mycoplasma is conducted after thawing. The acceptable percentage of cell death is approximately 5-10%, and increased cell death one passage after thawing justifies discarding the cell batch (Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf).

The criteria are also not quantified, which limits the completeness of the response.","The acceptance criteria for the MitoStressLUHMES assay (MSL) at the start of toxicity testing include several endpoints to ensure that the cultures are as expected. These criteria focus on the morphology, distribution, and viability of the LUHMES cells.

1. **Endpoints for Acceptance Criteria:**
   - Cells should have neurites approximately as long as their cell body when trypsinized for re-plating.
   - Cells should be evenly distributed before the medium change on the day of the assay.
   - Cells must not be contaminated.
   - The confluency of the cells should be about 80%.

2. **Analytical Methods:**
   - Visual inspection is primarily used to assess morphology and distribution.
   - Cell viability can be evaluated through staining methods, such as using Hoechst H-33342 to identify cells.

3. **Values for Acceptance Criteria:**
   - Cells should exhibit healthy morphology and be adherent after the medium change.
   - Oxygen levels should start at approximately 150 mmHg for each measurement and must not drop below 60 mmHg during the assay.

4. **Historical Controls:**
   - The performance of the test system regarding acceptance criteria is monitored over multiple differentiation runs. Historical data should show that the criteria are consistently met, with specific averages and variations documented for parameters such as cell viability and neurite length.

5. **Actions if Acceptance Criteria are Not Met:**
   - If the cells do not meet the specified criteria (e.g., if cell viability is below 80% or if contamination is observed), the batch should be discarded, and a new cell batch should be prepared. Additionally, if the morphology or distribution is not satisfactory, the experiment should be repeated with a fresh culture.

The following parameters are considered important for assessing the cells:

1. **Cell Morphology and Distribution**: 
   - Cells should have neurites approximately as long as their cell body when trypsinized for re-plating on day 2.
   - Cells must be evenly distributed before the medium change on day 3.
   - Cells should not be contaminated.

2. **Confluency**:

3. **Adherence**: 
   - Cells must remain adherent after the medium change on day 3.

4. **Oxygen Levels**: 
   - Oxygen levels should start at approximately 150 mmHg for each measurement and must not drop below 60 mmHg.

5. **Nuclei Morphology**: 
   - Nuclei should show a healthy morphology after compound treatment.

If these acceptance criteria are not met, actions may include discarding the cell batch or repeating the experiment. For example, if the average neurite length is below a specified threshold (e.g., 25 μm in negative controls), the experiment would be discarded. 

Historical controls and performance data regarding these acceptance criteria are not explicitly provided in the documents, indicating that specific averages and variations for the acceptance criteria parameters have not been established.

The answer could be improved by including these missing elements and providing more detailed guidance on handling and control measures.","The known causes of variability for the final test system state in the MitoStressLUHMES assay (MSL) include:

1. **Critical Consumables or Batch Effects:**
   - Problems with coating (different batches of poly-L-ornithine and fibronectin) can lead to uneven cell distribution and clumping.
   - Variability in plastic ware from different suppliers can affect cell behavior.
   - Different lots of culture media and supplements can introduce variability.

2. **Critical Handling Steps and Influencing Factors:**
   - Cells should be evenly distributed before the medium change on day 3, and they must not be contaminated.
   - Confluency should be maintained at about 80% before seeding.
   - Special care is needed in pipetting to avoid introducing variability; pipetting should be performed left to right, top to bottom.
   - Steps should be performed quickly to minimize the time cells are at room temperature, especially during medium changes.

3. **Positive and Negative Controls:**
   - **Negative Control:** Solvent (0.1% DMSO final concentration). Expected values should show no significant change in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in response to control injection.
   - **Positive Control:** Tool compounds (e.g., oligomycin, FCCP, rotenone, antimycin A) should yield characteristic MitoStress Test profiles.

4. **Accepted Deviation:**
   - The acceptance criteria for the test system at the end of compound exposure include that OCR must not change significantly in response to control injection, and oxygen levels should start at approximately 150 mmHg and not drop below 60 mmHg.

5. **Recommendations to Increase/Ensure Reproducibility and Performance:**
   - Regularly check and standardize the quality of consumables, including plastic ware and culture media.
   - Maintain consistent cell passage numbers and avoid using cells beyond passage 20.
   - Ensure that all handling steps are performed by trained personnel to minimize human error.
   - Implement strict protocols for cell seeding and medium changes to maintain consistency.
   - Use internal controls to easily exclude artefacts and ensure that the assay conditions are optimal for each experiment.

It lacks a direct comparison or discussion of differences and gaps.,"The MitoStressLUHMES assay (MSL) utilizes LUHMES cells, which are derived from the ventral mesencephalon of an 8-week-old human female fetus, to mimic human dopaminergic neurons. However, there are several aspects where the test system may differ from actual human tissue:

1. **Developmental Stage**: The LUHMES cells are used at an early developmental stage (day 3 of differentiation) in the assay, which may not fully represent the mature state of human dopaminergic neurons found in vivo. This could affect the functional characteristics and responses to toxicants.

2. **Cellular Environment**: The assay is conducted in a controlled in vitro environment, which lacks the complex interactions and signaling pathways present in the human brain. This includes the absence of glial cells and other supporting cells that play critical roles in neuronal function and health.

3. **Maturation and Plasticity**: While LUHMES cells can differentiate into dopaminergic neurons, they may not exhibit the same level of maturation, synaptic connectivity, and plasticity as fully developed neurons in the human brain. This could impact their response to neurotoxicants and the overall predictive power of the assay.

4. **Genetic and Epigenetic Factors**: The LUHMES cells may not fully capture the genetic diversity and epigenetic modifications present in human populations, which can influence susceptibility to toxicants and neurotoxicity.

5. **Functional Activity**: Although LUHMES cells express key markers of dopaminergic neurons and show some functional activity, they may not replicate all aspects of neuronal function, such as neurotransmitter release dynamics and long-term potentiation or depression, which are critical for assessing neurotoxicity.

These gaps in analogy need to be considered when interpreting the results of the MitoStressLUHMES assay, particularly in the context of predicting human neurotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity outcomes.

Secondary endpoints may include the total cell count, which serves as a normalization endpoint to adjust the primary endpoints based on cell density. This normalization helps ensure that variations in cell number do not skew the results of mitochondrial function assessments. 

Additionally, potential reference/normalization endpoints could include protein content or housekeeping gene expression, although specific details on these were not provided in the context. 

Overall, the primary focus of the MSL assay is on mitochondrial function rather than direct cytotoxicity measures _(Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf)_.",0.7881532167371578,0.44918903708457947,-0.024789482355117798,0.17181429266929626

Additionally, it does not explain the quantification algorithm or how semi-quantitative estimates are obtained, which are crucial for a complete understanding of the method.","The MitoStressLUHMES assay (MSL) employs a series of analytical methods to assess mitochondrial respiration in human dopaminergic neurons derived from LUHMES cells. The key principles and steps of the analytical methods used in this assay are as follows:

1. **Cell Preparation**: LUHMES cells are cultured and differentiated into mature dopamine-like neurons. The cells are seeded in coated Agilent Seahorse XFe24-well plates and allowed to attach before the assay begins.

2. **Assay Medium**: The medium is changed to Seahorse assay medium one hour prior to the assay to prepare the cells for measurement.

3. **Measurement of Oxygen Consumption Rate (OCR)**: The Seahorse XF Analyzer is used to measure the OCR, which reflects mitochondrial respiration. The assay involves injecting test compounds and tool compounds sequentially to assess various mitochondrial parameters.

4. **Endpoints**: The assay measures multiple endpoints, including:
   - Total cell count per well
   - Acute response to the test compound
   - Basal respiration
   - ATP production-coupled respiration
   - Proton leak
   - Maximal respiration
   - Respiratory spare capacity
   - Non-mitochondrial respiration

5. **Imaging and Quantification**: After the OCR measurements, cells are stained with Hoechst H-33342 to visualize nuclei. The staining is imaged using a high-content microscope (Cellomics). The quantification algorithm identifies nuclei based on size, area, shape, and intensity, allowing for the calculation of total cell count per well. Typically, around 25 fields are imaged to obtain a representative sample of the cell population.

6. **Parallel Measurement**: The endpoints are measured in the same well under the same conditions, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of mitochondrial function in response to the test compounds.

This overview provides a general understanding of the analytical methods and key steps involved in the MitoStressLUHMES assay, sufficient for reviewers and regulators to grasp the methodology without detailing every procedural aspect. The assay is designed to yield insights into mitochondrial function and potential neurotoxicity of compounds tested.

This is calculated based on the following parameters: 

- Each plate can accommodate 6 compounds, with 1 concentration of each compound per plate, resulting in 6 data points per plate.
- The assay can run 3 plates per day, leading to 18 data points per day.
- Over a typical month (4 weeks), this results in 216 data points (18 data points/day * 12 days/month).

Regarding the possibility of repeated measures from the same dish, the assay design does not specify the extent to which repeated measures can be taken from the same dish. However, it is common in such assays to perform multiple measurements over time, provided that the cells remain viable and the conditions are controlled. The assay's acceptance criteria ensure that cells must maintain healthy morphology and oxygen levels must not drop below specified thresholds, which would influence the feasibility of repeated measures. 

Thus, while the assay allows for a high throughput of data points, the actual number of repeated measures would depend on the specific experimental design and the health of the cell cultures over time.

The scientific rationale for linking test method data to relevant in vivo adverse outcomes is based on the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurotoxicity, particularly in the context of developmental neurotoxicity. The assay utilizes LUHMES cells, which represent dopaminergic neurons of the central nervous system, to model the effects of toxicants on mitochondrial function, which is critical for neuronal health and function.

The toxicological target modeled by the MSL assay is the dopaminergic neurons, specifically focusing on mitochondrial respiration and its associated parameters. The biological processes reflected by the test method include mitochondrial respiration, which encompasses various aspects such as basal respiration, ATP production-coupled respiration, and maximal respiration. 

The assay also models toxicological events such as oxidative stress and potential cell death, as mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to increased oxidative stress and subsequent neuronal injury. The MSL assay is related to adverse outcomes such as impaired neuronal function and potential neurodevelopmental deficits, which can manifest as cognitive and motor deficits in humans.

It is sensitive to mitochondrial toxicants and can provide mechanistic information regarding the effects of compounds on mitochondrial respiration. 

**Strengths:**
- The assay is automated, which allows for high-throughput screening.
- It provides internal controls to easily exclude artefacts.
- It offers mechanistic insights into the effects of compounds on mitochondrial function, which is crucial for understanding neurotoxicity.

**Weaknesses:**
- The assay has not undergone formal validation and is not linked to regulatory guidelines, which may limit its acceptance in certain contexts.
- It predicts some aspects of neurotoxicity but does not cover all aspects addressed by in vivo neurotoxicity studies (TG424).

**Comparison to Similar Tests:**
The MSL assay is similar to other assays that assess mitochondrial function, such as the MitoComplexesLUHMES assay (MCL), which focuses on mitochondrial complex activity. While MSL assesses overall mitochondrial respiration and various parameters, MCL provides a more detailed analysis of individual mitochondrial complexes. Both assays can complement each other in a test battery.

**Gaps Filled:**
The MSL assay fills a gap in the assessment of developmental neurotoxicity by focusing on mitochondrial function during early neuronal development. It can be particularly useful for identifying potential neurotoxicants that affect mitochondrial respiration, which is a critical aspect of neuronal health.

**Tier Usage:**
The MSL assay is best suited for use in the first tier of a test battery, serving as an initial screening tool for mitochondrial toxicants. However, complementary assays may be required to provide a more comprehensive understanding of neurotoxicity, especially for compounds that may have effects beyond mitochondrial function.

In summary, while the MSL assay is a valuable tool in a test battery for neurotoxicity assessment, it should ideally be used alongside other assays to provide a more complete picture of a compound's potential neurotoxic effects _(Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf)_.",0.596872198992082,0.29384124279022217,-0.2578301429748535,-0.047583162784576416

However, it lacks clarity on whether the test method covers an AOP MIE/KE and does not reference the status of the AOP in AOP-wiki.","The MitoStressLUHMES assay (MSL) could potentially be linked to the following Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs):

- **AOP 3**: Inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I of nigra-striatal neurons leads to parkinsonian motor deficits. This AOP relates to the organ effects of degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway.

The MSL test method assesses mitochondrial respiration in human dopaminergic neurons, which aligns with the key events (KEs) outlined in this AOP. Specifically, it can be considered a test of KE activation as it evaluates the functional impairment of mitochondria, which is a critical aspect of the pathway leading to neurotoxicity.

For further details, the AOP can be referenced in the AOP-wiki, where its status can be checked for updates and validation. However, the specific status of AOP 3 in the AOP-wiki is not provided in the context.
