   - The LUHMES cells must be pathogen-free, with regular testing for mycoplasma after thawing.
   - Cells should exhibit an oval morphology and should not form extensive aggregates or clustering.
   - Approximately 5-10% cell death (dead cells floating in the flask) is considered normal. Increased cell death one passage after thawing justifies discarding the cell batch.
   - The culture medium should not be yellow, indicating proper cell health.

2. **Functional Parameters:**
   - Cells should express specific markers indicative of their dopaminergic phenotype, such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression, which depends on the presence of cAMP in the culture medium.
   - Cells should demonstrate neurite outgrowth after 24 hours of differentiation and show electrical activity after 6 days of differentiation.

3. **Pluripotency Control (for iPSC maintenance):**
   - The LUHMES cells are derived from a human fetal mesencephalon and are not iPSCs; therefore, pluripotency control is not applicable in this context.

4. **Stability Over Passages:**
   - Cells are cultured until passage 20, and the behavior of cells may vary with passage number. It is recommended to thaw a new batch if significant changes in morphology or behavior are observed.

5. **Quantitative Definitions for AC:**
   - Cells should have a confluency of about 60% at the time of treatment.
   - The acceptance criteria are primarily based on visual inspection rather than strict quantitative measures.

6. **Exclusion Criteria:**
   - Cells that show contamination, significant morphological abnormalities, or excessive cell death should be excluded from use in experiments.

7. **Special Requirements for Genetically-Modified Cells:**
   - The LUHMES cells used in the assay are genetically modified (immortalized with a LINX v-myc retroviral vector), and thus must be handled in accordance with specific safety and ethical guidelines for genetically-modified organisms.

However, it lacks detail on critical consumables, batch effects, and specific handling steps. It also does not provide recommendations to increase reproducibility and performance, nor does it address special requirements for genetically-modified cells and microphysiological systems.","The known causes of variability of the initial/source cells in the MitoMet assay (UKN4b) include:

1. **Plastic Coating**: Problems with coating can lead to uneven cell distribution, causing cell clumping and aggregation. It is critical to ensure proper coating of plates and flasks with poly-L-ornithine and fibronectin solutions.

2. **Cell Passage Number**: The behavior and morphology of cells can change with different passage numbers. Older cells may exhibit different characteristics, and it may be beneficial to thaw a new batch if variability is observed.

3. **Supplier Variability**: Different suppliers of plastic ware may produce plates and flasks that behave differently, affecting cell growth and behavior.

4. **Cell Lot Variability**: Variability can occur between different vials of the same cell lot, which may have been frozen at the same time but can still show differences in performance.

5. **Medium and Supplement Variability**: Different lots of culture medium and supplements can affect cell behavior. Consistency in the source of fetal calf serum (FCS) or serum replacements is important.

6. **Cell Density**: Maintaining the appropriate cell density is crucial. Confluency should not exceed 40-90%, as too high a density can impair metabolism and slow differentiation.

7. **Washing Procedures**: Inadequate washing during cell handling can lead to residual substances affecting cell behavior. It is recommended to wash with PBS instead of MilliQ water if problems occur.

8. **Pipetting Techniques**: Special care is needed during pipetting to avoid introducing variability. Pipetting should be performed quickly to minimize the time cells are exposed to room temperature.

To increase and ensure reproducibility and performance, the following recommendations can be made:

- **Standardize Cell Culture Conditions**: Use the same supplier for all critical consumables, including plastic ware and culture media, to minimize variability.

- **Regularly Monitor Cell Health**: Conduct regular checks for contamination and cell morphology to ensure that only healthy cells are used in experiments.

- **Optimize Coating Procedures**: Ensure that plates and flasks are properly coated and used immediately after preparation to avoid issues with cell attachment.

- **Maintain Consistent Cell Passage**: Use cells within a defined passage range and avoid using cells that are too old or have been passaged too many times.

- **Implement Rigorous Training**: Ensure that all personnel are trained in the specific techniques required for handling LUHMES cells and using the high-content imaging system.

However, it lacks information on the percentage of contaminating cells, the percentage of each subpopulation in co-cultures, and whether specific chemicals show differential cytotoxicity for the cell sub-populations used. These omissions prevent a 'High' score.","The test system used in the MitoMet assay (UKN4b) involves LUHMES cells, which are human dopaminergic neurons derived from the ventral mesencephalon of an 8-week-old female fetus. The generation of the test system includes differentiation steps, as LUHMES cells are differentiated into mature dopamine-like neurons through a two-step process involving specific growth factors and conditions.

### General Features/Principles of the Culture Protocol:
1. **Differentiation Steps**: 
   - On day -1, proliferating LUHMES cells are seeded in proliferation medium.
   - On day 0, the medium is changed to differentiation medium, which includes tetracycline (to initiate differentiation), GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor), and db-cAMP (to promote neuronal characteristics).
   - The cells are cultured for 6 days to achieve differentiation into mature neurons.

2. **Culture Conditions**: 
   - Cells are typically cultured in a 2D monolayer but can also grow into 3D structures.
   - The differentiation medium is based on Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with specific nutrients and growth factors.

3. **Contamination and Cell Population**: 
   - The LUHMES cells must be pathogen-free, and regular testing for mycoplasma is conducted. 
   - The acceptance criteria for the source cell population indicate that approximately 5-10% cell death is considered normal, and increased cell death after thawing justifies discarding the cell batch.

4. **Sensitivity to Cytotoxicity**: 
   - The LUHMES cells express various neuronal transporters and receptors and are electrophysiologically active, which makes them sensitive to toxicants, particularly mitochondrial toxicants.
   - Specific chemicals or chemical classes that show differential cytotoxicity for the LUHMES cells have not been detailed in the provided context, but the assay is designed to detect mitochondrial toxicants and other neurotoxic compounds.

### Subpopulations and Sensitivity:
- The context does not specify the presence of distinct subpopulations within the LUHMES cells or their relative sensitivity to cytotoxicity. However, the overall sensitivity of the LUHMES cells to toxicants is highlighted, particularly in relation to mitochondrial function.

In summary, the LUHMES cells used in the MitoMet assay undergo a defined differentiation process to become dopaminergic neurons, and while the assay is sensitive to various toxicants, specific details regarding subpopulations and their differential sensitivity are not provided in the context.

However, it lacks detailed acceptance criteria, specific endpoints, analytical methods, and historical control data. The criteria are not quantified, and there is no mention of actions if acceptance criteria are not met.","The acceptance criteria for the MitoMet assay (UKN4b) at the start of toxicity testing include several endpoints to ensure that the cultures are as expected. These criteria focus on the morphology, viability, and overall health of the LUHMES cells used in the assay.

1. **Endpoints for Acceptance Criteria:**
   - **Morphology:** Cells should have neurites approximately as long as their cell bodies when trypsinized for re-plating.
   - **Contamination:** Cells must not be contaminated.
   - **Confluency:** The confluency of the cells should be about 60%.

2. **Analytical Methods:**
   - **Visual Inspection:** The criteria are primarily based on visual inspection rather than quantitative measurements.
   - **Staining:** Live staining with calcein-AM and Hoechst H-33342 can be used to assess cell viability and morphology, although specific quantitative thresholds are not defined for the acceptance criteria.

3. **Values to be Reached:**
   - Cells should exhibit the expected morphology (neurite length).
   - Cells should be free from contamination.
   - Confluency should be around 60% at the time of treatment.

4. **Historical Controls:**
   - The document does not provide specific historical control data regarding the acceptance criteria parameters. However, it indicates that the criteria are based on visual inspection and general observations from previous experiments.

5. **Actions if Acceptance Criteria are Not Met:**
   - If the cells do not meet the acceptance criteria (e.g., if they are contaminated or not exhibiting the expected morphology), they should be discarded, and a new batch of cells should be prepared for the assay.

These criteria ensure that the LUHMES cells used in the MitoMet assay are healthy and suitable for assessing neurotoxicity.

2. **Contamination**: Cells must not be contaminated. This is also assessed visually.

3. **Cell Density**: The confluency of the cells should be approximately 60% at the time of treatment. This is a qualitative measure based on visual inspection.

It does not explicitly mention critical handling steps, positive and negative controls, or provide specific recommendations to increase reproducibility and performance. The answer could be improved by including these missing elements and providing more detailed guidance on handling and control measures.","The known causes of variability for the final test system state in the MitoMet assay (UKN4b) include:

1. **Critical Consumables or Batch Effects:**
   - Variability can arise from different batches of plastic ware, as different manufacturers or lots may affect cell behavior.
   - The quality of the coating (PLO/fibronectin) can lead to issues with cell distribution and clumping.
   - Variability in the culture medium and supplements can also impact cell performance.

2. **Critical Handling Steps and Influencing Factors:**
   - **Pipetting:** Special care is needed during pipetting to ensure that substances are added correctly. For instance, substances should be added when pipette tips are just above the medium surface to avoid droplet sticking to the well walls.
   - **Timing:** Steps such as cell seeding and medium changes should be performed quickly to minimize the time cells spend at room temperature.
   - **Cell Density:** Maintaining an appropriate cell density is crucial; confluency should not exceed 40-90% to avoid impaired metabolism and slow differentiation.

3. **Positive and Negative Controls:**
   - **Positive Control:** Narciclasine (50 nM final concentration) is used as a positive control for neurite growth inhibition. Expected values are that neurite area should be ≤ 75% of DMSO control, and viability should be ≥ 90% of DMSO control.
   - **Negative Control:** Solvent (0.1% DMSO final concentration) should yield a neurite area ≥ 35,000.

4. **Accepted Deviation:**
   - The accepted deviation for positive controls is that neurite area should be ≤ 75% of DMSO control and viability should be ≥ 90% of DMSO control. For negative controls, neurite area should be ≥ 35,000.

5. **Recommendations to Increase/Ensure Reproducibility and Performance:**
   - Use consistent batches of consumables and reagents to minimize variability.
   - Ensure thorough training for operators to reduce pipetting errors and improve handling speed.
   - Regularly check and maintain equipment, such as the Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS Reader, to ensure consistent performance.
   - Implement strict protocols for cell culture maintenance and handling to ensure cells are in optimal condition before testing.
   - Document all experimental conditions meticulously to identify and control for variability in future experiments.

While these cells exhibit characteristics similar to mature dopaminergic neurons, there are notable differences and gaps in analogy to consider:

1. **Developmental Stage**: The LUHMES cells are derived from a fetal source and may not fully replicate the complexity and maturity of adult human dopaminergic neurons. This can affect the expression of certain proteins and the overall functionality of the neurons compared to those in a fully developed human brain.

2. **Neuronal Network Formation**: Although LUHMES cells can form neuronal networks, the extent and complexity of these networks may not fully represent the intricate connections found in vivo. The assay may not capture all aspects of synaptic formation and plasticity that occur in a mature human brain.

3. **Environmental Factors**: The in vitro environment in which LUHMES cells are cultured lacks the full range of biochemical and physical cues present in the human central nervous system. Factors such as extracellular matrix components, glial cell interactions, and blood-brain barrier dynamics are not fully replicated, which can influence neuronal behavior and responses to toxicants.

4. **Functional Activity**: While LUHMES cells can exhibit electrical activity and express certain neurotransmitter receptors, the functional properties may differ from those of mature neurons in terms of neurotransmitter release, receptor signaling, and response to stimuli.

5. **Response to Toxicants**: The sensitivity of LUHMES cells to toxicants may not fully reflect the responses of mature human neurons, particularly in the context of chronic exposure or complex mixtures of compounds.

   - **Cell Number:** This endpoint is measured to provide additional context regarding the effects of toxicants on cell proliferation.
   - **Percentage of Viable Cells:** This reference endpoint is used to assess overall cell viability in conjunction with the primary endpoint.

3. **Potential Reference/Normalization Endpoints:**
   - **Cytotoxicity:** The percentage of viable cells serves as a normalization endpoint to ensure that changes in neurite area are not solely due to cell death.
   - **Cell Staining:** The use of calcein-AM staining allows for the identification of viable cells, which can be used to normalize the primary endpoint measurements.

The cell staining is imaged in a Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS reader. Hoechst H-33342 staining is imaged in channel 1 (UV-Hoechst); calcein staining is imaged in channel 2 (Green-FITC). Exposure times are set manually. To measure the neurite area, the software acquires the Hoechst signal in channel 1 to identify the cells as objects (via identification of the nuclei), and the calcein-AM signal in channel 2 to measure neurite area. Double positive cells are counted as viable.",Medium,"The answer provides a partial overview of the analytical method, including staining procedures and imaging details. However, it lacks a comprehensive description of the method's principles and key steps, such as whether cells are fixed or homogenized. It also does not address whether viability and neurite outgrowth are measured in the same well or independently. The explanation of the quantification algorithm is minimal, and there is no mention of the number of cells imaged.","The MitoMet assay (UKN4b) employs high-content imaging to assess two primary endpoints: neurite outgrowth and cell viability in human dopaminergic neurons (LUHMES cells). The key steps of the analytical method are as follows:

1. **Cell Preparation**: LUHMES cells are cultured and differentiated into dopaminergic neurons. On day 2 of differentiation, cells are trypsinized and replated onto 96-well plates in differentiation medium containing galactose instead of glucose.

2. **Toxicant Exposure**: After approximately 30 minutes to 2 hours of cell attachment, compounds (toxicants) are added to the wells for a 24-hour exposure period.

3. **Staining**: Following the exposure, cells are live-stained with 1 µg/ml Hoechst H-33342 (to label all nuclei) and 1 µM calcein-AM (to mark viable cells). This staining is performed for 30 minutes.

4. **Imaging**: After staining, cells are imaged using a high-content microscope (Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS reader). Ten fields per well are typically imaged, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the cell population.

5. **Quantification**: The quantification of neurite outgrowth and cell viability is performed using image analysis algorithms. The software identifies nuclei in the Hoechst channel to determine cell count and neurite area in the calcein channel. The neurite area is calculated by identifying neurite pixels while excluding the cell soma area, which is defined around each nucleus.

Both endpoints (neurite outgrowth and cell viability) are measured in the same well under the same conditions, allowing for a parallel assessment of the effects of toxicants on both parameters.

In terms of imaging, the algorithm processes the images to quantify the neurite area and viable cell count, ensuring that a sufficient number of cells are analyzed to provide reliable data. The exact number of cells imaged can vary, but typically, a significant portion of the well is covered to ensure statistical relevance in the results _(Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_.",0.7211404733888247,0.28228461742401123,0.06778575479984283,0.16918151080608368
"Provide information on machine settings, analytical standards, data processing and normalization procedures. For imaging endpoints: provide detailed algorithm. This information should also be covered in an SOP, preferably in DB-ALM format (see link in 6.6).","Quantification of neurite outgrowth An automated microplate reading microscope (Array-ScanII HCS Reader, Cellomics, PA) equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera (resolution 1024 x 1024; run at 2 x 2 binning) was used for image acquisition. Ten fields per well were imaged. Images were recorded in 2 channels using a 20x objective and excitation/emission wavelengths of 365 ± 50/535 ± 45 to detect H-33342 in channel 1 and 474 ± 40/535 ± 45 to detect calcein in channel 2. In both channels, a fixed exposure time and an intensity histogram-derived threshold were used for object identification. Neurite pixels were identified using the following image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified as objects in channel 1 according to their size, area, shape, and intensity which were predefined on untreated cells using a machine-based learning algorithm, and manual selection of nuclei to be classified as intact. The nuclear outlines were expanded by 3.2 µm in each direction, to define a virtual cell soma area (VCSA) based on the following procedure: The average width of the cytoplasm ring (distance nucleus - cell membrane) of LUHMES cells was experimentally determined to be 2.3 µm. Size irregularities were not always due to growing neurites, as determined by combined F-actin/tubulin beta-III staining. To avoid scoring of false positive neurite areas, the exclusion ring (VCSA) was made bigger than the average cell size. Then, we used two control compounds (U0126 and bisindolylmaleimid I) to vary the expanded outlines from 0.6 to 4 µm. We found 3.2 µm to be optimal both to detect neurite growth over time and to identify reduced neurite growth with high sensitivity. All calcein-positive pixels of the field (beyond a given intensity threshold) were defined as viable cellular structures (VCSs). The threshold was dynamically determined for each field after flat field and background correction and intensity normalization to 512 gray values and was set to12% of the maximal brightness (channel 63 of 512). The VCS defines the sum of all somata and neurites without their assignment to individual cells. In an automatic calculation, the VCSAs, defined in the H- 33342 channel, were used as filter in the calcein channel and subtracted from the VCS. The remaining pixels (VCS - VCSA) in the calcein channel were defined as neurite area. Quantification of individual viable cells by imaging For a quantitative assessment of viable cells, the same images used to assess neurite area were analysed using another image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified in channel 1 as objects according to their size, area, shape, and intensity. Nuclei of apoptotic cells with increased fluorescence were excluded. A VCSA was defined around each nucleus by expanding it by 0.3 µm into each direction. Calcein-AM staining, labelling live cells, was detected in channel 2. The algorithm quantified the calcein intensity in the VCSA areas. Cells having an average calcein signal intensity in the VCSAs below a predefined threshold were classified by the program as “not viable”. Valid nuclei with a positive calcein signal in their cognate VCSA were counted as viable cells. A positive calcein signal was based on measurements of the average intensity (normal cells: 1300 ± 115, threshold: < 50) and the total integrated intensity (normal cells: 186,000 ± 23,600, threshold < 1000) of cells.",Medium,"The answer provides detailed information on the imaging equipment, settings, and algorithms used for neurite outgrowth quantification and viable cell assessment.

Given that the assay can handle 5 compounds per plate and 10 different concentrations of each compound, this results in 50 data points per plate. With the capacity to run 6 plates per day, the total data points generated in a month (assuming three working weeks) would be:

- 6 plates/day * 50 data points/plate * 15 days/month = 1200 data points/month.

Regarding the possibility of repeated measures from the same dish, the assay allows for the potential to measure the same conditions over time, particularly if the cells are maintained in a suitable state for extended periods. However, the specifics of repeated measures would depend on the experimental design and the stability of the cell culture over time.

The experimenter plans the experiment in advance, ensuring that all necessary steps are completed in a timely manner to maintain cell viability.

Adherence to plate maps during pipetting is documented in the lab book and in Excel files stored on the work group server. Plate maps are defined prior to the experiment, and any pipetting errors are marked directly on these maps.

Routine procedures for documenting intermediate steps include noting experimental procedures manually in a paper lab book. Errors, such as pipetting twice in one well, are documented immediately in the lab book to maintain an accurate record of the experiment.

The plate wells are used sequentially, typically starting from the leftmost column and moving to the right. This systematic approach helps to minimize errors and maintain consistency throughout the experiment.

It also describes known pitfalls and potential operator mistakes, providing a complete and relevant response.","The MitoMet assay (UKN4b) is sensitive to various experimental challenges and potential pitfalls. Here are the details regarding problematic compounds, experimental variables, critical handling steps, robustness issues, and known pitfalls:

1. **Problematic Compounds:**
   - Compounds with low solubility can lead to issues during dilution and testing.
   - Some compounds may exhibit autofluorescence, which can interfere with the detection of calcein-AM or H-33342, affecting the analytical endpoints _(Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_.

2. **Experimental Variables:**
   - Variability can arise from differences in plastic ware, as different manufacturers or batches may affect cell behavior.
   - The passage number of cells can influence their morphology and behavior, making it difficult to control for consistency _(Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_.

3. **Critical Handling Steps:**
   - Proper coating of flasks and plates is essential to ensure even cell distribution; issues with coating can lead to cell clumping and aggregation.
   - Cells should be handled quickly to minimize the time they spend at room temperature during critical steps like seeding and medium changes _(Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_.

4. **Robustness Issues:**
   - Variability in test performance can occur due to operator training, as inexperienced operators may introduce errors.
   - Seasonal changes may affect laboratory conditions, potentially impacting cell growth and assay results.
   - The use of certain consumables, such as plastic ware from different suppliers, can lead to variations in cell behavior _(Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_.

5. **Known Pitfalls:**
   - Operators may make mistakes in pipetting, such as not adding compounds at the correct height above the medium surface, which can lead to poor mixing or loss of compound efficacy.
   - Focusing failures of the imaging equipment can produce outliers in data, as can imaging only one channel instead of both required channels _(Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_.
   - Inadequate training can lead to improper handling of the multichannel and multistep pipettes, resulting in increased variance in results _(Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_.

It specifies the toxicological target (central nervous system with a dopaminergic phenotype), the biological process (neurite outgrowth), and the toxicological events (mitochondrial toxicity) modeled. It also relates the test method to human adverse outcomes and potential hazards it predicts, providing a comprehensive and relevant response.","The MitoMet assay (UKN4b) is designed to model neurotoxicity, specifically focusing on human dopaminergic neurons. The scientific rationale for linking test method data to relevant in vivo adverse outcomes is based on the ability of LUHMES cells, which are used in this assay, to represent cells of the central nervous system with a dopaminergic phenotype. This allows for the assessment of neurite outgrowth and cellular viability, which are critical indicators of neuronal health and function.

The toxicological target modeled by the assay is the central nervous system, particularly the dopaminergic neurons. The biological processes reflected by the test method include neurite outgrowth and differentiation, which are essential for neuronal connectivity and function.

The assay also models toxicological events such as mitochondrial dysfunction, which can lead to oxidative stress and cell death. The MitoMet assay is particularly sensitive to mitochondrial toxicants, making it relevant for predicting potential neurotoxic effects.

The adverse outcomes related to this test method include neurodevelopmental toxicity and impairment of neuronal function, which can manifest as cognitive deficits or neurodegenerative diseases. The hazards that the MitoMet assay potentially predicts include neurotoxicity, particularly from compounds that affect mitochondrial function, cytoskeletal integrity, and neuronal signaling pathways _(Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_.",0.7882601088964073,0.36791807413101196,0.16344839334487915,0.2608683705329895

Due to the high similarity of the two assays, it is also used for the UKN4b assay. a) The prediction model was established using the following compounds (Stiegler 2011; Krug 2013): -colchicine -vincristine -nocodazole  Positive controls -etoposide -buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)  Unspecific toxicants affecting general viability -cycloheximide -paraquat  Rules of assay interpretation, criteria to define a positive test result -CCCP -2,4-DNP -SDS -tween-20 -K2CrO4 -H-33352 -tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (tBuOOH)  Unspecific toxicants b) The prediction model has been applied to screen 80 compound library of NTP (Delp et al., 2018).

The use of the updated prediction model BMC25 Viability (V) / BMC25 Neurite Area (NA) ≥ 4 was validated by comparing classifications derived by the initial and the updated prediction model. The reason for updating the prediction model was that a decrease of 50% in neurite area and viability cannot always be achieved with our range of test concentrations. An effect of 25% is more often observed and came to similar results when applied (Delp et al., 2018).",Medium,"The answer provides some relevant information about the prediction model setup, including the chemicals used and documentation references. However, it lacks clarity and completeness in addressing all aspects of the question, such as the specific classifiers/statistical approaches used, how the model applies to changes on both sides of controls, and how data in the opposite direction are handled. The explanation of the two-sided nature of the model and its interpretation is also insufficient.","The prediction model for the MitoMet assay (UKN4b) was established using a set of chemicals that included both positive controls and unspecific toxicants. The chemicals used for training the model included:

- Positive controls: colchicine, vincristine, nocodazole
- Unspecific toxicants affecting general viability: etoposide, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), cycloheximide, paraquat

The process of setting up the prediction model is documented in publications, specifically in works by Stiegler et al. (2011) and Krug et al. (2013) _(Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_.

The prediction model applies to changes on both sides of controls (up/down). It includes a prediction model for screening that identifies hits based on a decrease or increase in neurite area while maintaining viability. Specifically, a decrease in neurite area is considered a hit if it is ≤ 80% of the DMSO control, while viability must remain ≥ 90% of the DMSO control _(Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_.

For data in the opposite direction (e.g., increases in neurite area), the model interprets these changes as potential effects or toxicity, but the specific thresholds and performance characteristics may differ. The model has been validated with a variety of compounds, and the performance indicators have been assessed, indicating that the model can handle both increases and decreases in neurite area and viability, although the interpretation of these effects may vary _(Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_. 

In summary, the prediction model is two-sided, allowing for the interpretation of both increases and decreases in neurite area and viability, with different rules and thresholds potentially applying to each side.",0.8196092538926495,0.16767913103103638,0.16288045048713684,0.16862967610359192

Due to the high similarity of the two assays, a comparable test performance is expected for the UKN3b assay. Some background on the test performance is given in chapters 8.2/8.3 (prediction model). Several performance parameters for the test were obtained in several separate evaluation rounds. A first evaluation was done during the first publication of the model and its applications (Stiegler et al. 2011, Krueg et al. 2013). Here, a panel of well-selected positive and negative controls have been tested. Accordingly, the specificity was 100% and the sensitivity was > 90 %. In dedicated experiments, S/N ratios of > 20 and a z’ of > 0.5 have been determined. The compound narciclasine (run on each plate as positive control) was tested across 36 different test plates and 12 independent assay runs. The neurite area relative to the solvent control varied between 40% and 75% across all plates with a viability value constantly >90% (Delp et al. 2018). The test has been used in screening campaigns, and real-live performance data under broader screen conditions have been obtained. The different performance data need to be considered, when a compound is a hit in a screen, or whether it has been specifically evaluated in a hit follow-up or a mechanistic project. A first screen application has been the NTP80 screen (80 compounds provided by the US NTP). Data are published Delp et al. 2018. A second screen application has been the cross systems case study of the EU-ToxRisk project. The baseline variation is indicated in Krebs et al., 2020. Moreover, an overview is given for 19 compounds on the BMC/BMCL ratio as measure of readout certainty. A third screen was performed in the context of the EFSA DNT test battery evaluation with 120 compounds (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). From this screen the following performance indicators were obtained: A: Sensitivity: 100%  With NeuriTox as standalone assay in 17 `tool negatives´ tested (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). B: Specificity: 82.7%  With NeuriTox combined in a full DNT battery and a selected set of 27 positive compounds with evidence for DNT (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). C: Baseline variation (intra-experimental) Neurite outgrowth: 11.7 ± 4.5% Cell viability: 3.8 ± 3.5% D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) Neurite outgrowth: 15.3% Cell viability: 4.3% E: Variation of a positive control run on each (inter-experimental) Neurite outgrowth: 38.5% Definition of values C-E C: Baseline variation (intra-experimental) is the mean CV±SD of the CV of all replicates of the solvent control from each experiment across n>200 experiments. D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) is the variability across all independent experiments (n>200) after normalization based on the response of the lowest test concentration. It was assumed that the lowest test concentration does not affect any of the endpoints measured. E: Variation of a positive control run on each (inter-experimental) is the variability of the positive control across all independent experiments (n>40) after normalization. Example for a positive control that on average reduced the specific endpoint down to 40% (relative to solvent control) and a calculated variability of 50%: 0.5 x 40% = +/- 20%  The positive control with mean of 40% varies from 20% to 60%.",High,"The answer provides a comprehensive evaluation of the test method's performance parameters, including specificity, sensitivity, signal/noise ratio, z-factor, baseline variation, and inter-operator variations.

It is designed to assess neurotoxicity, particularly focusing on mitochondrial toxicants and dopaminergic neurons. 

**Strengths:**
- The assay is sensitive to mitochondrial toxicants, cytoskeletal toxicants, and some signaling modifiers, making it a valuable tool for screening potential neurotoxic compounds.
- It allows for medium to high throughput due to automated microscopy, which enhances its utility in large-scale screening efforts.
- The assay specifically measures neurite outgrowth in CNS dopaminergic neurons, providing insights that are not captured by peripheral neuron assays.

**Weaknesses:**
- The assay has not undergone formal validation or ring trials, which may limit its acceptance in regulatory contexts.
- It may not capture all aspects of neurotoxicity covered by in vivo studies, particularly those not related to mitochondrial function.

**Comparison to Similar Tests:**
The MitoMet assay is similar to other assays that assess neurite integrity and outgrowth, such as the UKN3 assays. However, it is specifically tailored to detect mitochondrial toxicants with increased sensitivity compared to peripheral neuron assays. The performance indicators suggest that it has high sensitivity (>90%) and specificity (100%) in initial evaluations, which is comparable to other established neurotoxicity assays.

**Gaps Filled:**
The MitoMet assay addresses the need for a specific test that can detect mitochondrial toxicants in dopaminergic neurons, which is crucial for understanding neurodevelopmental toxicity. It complements existing assays by providing a focused approach to assessing neurotoxicity related to mitochondrial dysfunction.

**Tier Usage:**
The assay is best suited for use in the first tier of a testing battery, serving as an initial screening tool for neurotoxic potential. While it can provide valuable insights on its own, complementary assays may be required to confirm findings and assess broader neurotoxic effects, particularly those not related to mitochondrial function.

However, it lacks clarity on whether the test method specifically covers an AOP MIE/KE and does not reference the status of these AOPs in the AOP-wiki. The response is partially complete but lacks specific details and clarity required for a 'High' score.","The MitoMet assay (UKN4b) could potentially be linked to several Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs). Specifically, it models neurite outgrowth as a biological process and assesses cell viability, which allows it to be integrated into adverse outcome pathways as a key event to predict potential adverse outcomes in humans. 

The relevant AOPs include:

1. **AOP 48**: Binding of agonists to ionotropic glutamate receptors in the adult brain causes excitotoxicity that mediates neuronal cell death, contributing to learning and memory impairment.
2. **AOP 13**: Chronic binding of antagonists to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) during brain development induces impairment of learning and memory abilities.
3. **AOP 3**: Inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I of nigra-striatal neurons leads to parkinsonian motor deficits.
4. **AOP 42**: Inhibition of Thyroperoxidase and subsequent adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in mammals.
5. **AOP 54**: Inhibition of Na+/I- symporter (NIS) decreases TH synthesis leading to learning and memory deficits in children.
6. **AOP 8**: Upregulation of Thyroid Hormone Catabolism via Activation of Hepatic Nuclear Receptors, and subsequent adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in mammals.
7. **AOP 134**: Sodium Iodide Symporter (NIS) Inhibition and subsequent adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in mammals.

The assay can cover key events (KE) in these AOPs, particularly those related to neurotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the specific status of these AOPs in the AOP-wiki is not provided in the documents. 

Overall, the MitoMet assay serves as a valuable tool for assessing neurotoxicity and could be integrated into AOP frameworks to better understand the mechanisms of chemical-induced neurotoxic effects _(Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_.",0.7549795150283246,0.5507179498672485,0.4034094214439392,0.47568845748901367

It also discusses the role of tubulin and the Rho/Rock pathway in neurite outgrowth. However, it lacks a comprehensive exploration of how the system reflects human biology and tissue organization relevant to the specific form of toxicity. The mention of a lack of formal mechanistic validation and references to other studies suggest incompleteness in addressing the question fully.","The mechanistic validation of the MitoMet assay (UKN4b) has not been formally performed, but it has been explored through the use of endpoint-specific controls (MCC) and the characterization of the LUHMES cells.

The LUHMES cells used in this assay are derived from human dopaminergic neurons and exhibit characteristics relevant to human biology, including the expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which are critical for dopaminergic function. The cells are capable of forming neuronal networks and are electrophysiologically active, reflecting aspects of human neuronal signaling and tissue organization relevant to neurotoxicity assessment _(Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_.

While the assay is sensitive to mitochondrial toxicants and cytoskeletal toxicants, it has not been linked to specific regulatory guidelines, and no formal OECD validation study has been conducted.
