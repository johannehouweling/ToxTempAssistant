3. **Re-plating (Day 2):**  
   - Cells reach approximately 20-30 million per T75 flask.  
   - They are trypsinized and re-plated onto coated Seahorse XF24-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells per well in 100 µl of differentiation medium without cAMP and GDNF.  
   - After 1 hour of attachment, the wells are filled with 500 µl of differentiation medium.

4. **Assay Preparation (Day 3):**  
   - The medium is replaced with Seahorse assay medium (Seahorse XF DMEM, pH 7.4, supplemented with pyruvate, glucose or galactose, glutamine, and tetracycline).  
   - The cartridge is rehydrated in XF Calibrant and incubated at 37°C without CO₂.  
   - The Seahorse XF Analyzer is switched on.

**Media and Substrates:**  
- Differentiation medium contains tetracycline (1 µg/ml) to initiate differentiation, GDNF (2 ng/ml), and db-cAMP (1 mM).  
- Seahorse assay medium is based on XF DMEM with supplements, including pyruvate, glucose or galactose, glutamine, and tetracycline.

**Manipulation Steps:**  
- Medium changes are performed at specific days: from proliferation to differentiation medium on Day 0, and medium replacement with assay medium on Day 3.  
- Cells are trypsinized and re-plated onto coated plates at Day 2 to ensure proper cell attachment and maturation.  
- Coating involves poly-L-ornithine and fibronectin to promote cell adhesion.  
- The assay involves sequential injections of test compounds and mitochondrial modulators, with measurements of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) to assess mitochondrial function.

**Special Requirements for Microphysiological Systems and Organoids:**  
- For 3D systems or organoids, additional steps such as cell printing, self-aggregation, or self-organization may be necessary.  
- Interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM) or scaffold materials is critical, influencing size, shape, and structural integrity.  
- Geometrical characterization includes size and shape assessment to ensure reproducibility and proper tissue architecture.  
- These systems may require specific bioprinting techniques, matrix composition, and controlled culture conditions to support tissue-like organization and function.

However, it lacks detail on the analytical methods used to evaluate these criteria, specific values for acceptance, and historical control data. The criteria are also not quantified, which limits the completeness of the response.","The assay uses several endpoints to ensure that the culture(s) are as expected at the start of toxicity testing, focusing on morphological and visual criteria rather than specific molecular markers. The key acceptance criteria include:

- **Cell morphology and distribution:** Cells should exhibit an oval morphology, be evenly distributed, and not form extensive aggregates or clustering.  
- **Confluency:** Cultures should have approximately 80% confluence before seeding for the assay, with a confluency not exceeding 90%.  
- **Adherence:** Cells must remain adherent after medium change and during the setup process.  
- **Contamination status:** Cultures should be free of contamination, including mycoplasma.  
- **Cell viability:** Although not explicitly quantified, visual inspection should confirm healthy, adherent cells with minimal detachment or cell death.  
- **Cell density:** For LUHMES cells, the density should be around 60,000 cells per well when seeded, and the cells should reach the appropriate density for differentiation and assay performance.

**Methods used to evaluate these criteria include:**

- **Visual inspection:** Microscopic examination for morphology, confluency, and contamination.  
- **Cell counting and imaging:** Using high-content microscopy (e.g., Cellomics Array Scan VTI) to assess cell attachment, distribution, and morphology.  
- **Mycoplasma testing:** Regular testing of working stocks for pathogen contamination.  
- **Marker gene expression (if applicable):** Although not routinely performed at the start, differentiation markers such as βIII-tubulin, Fox-3/NeuN, and Ki-67 are used during differentiation validation, not specifically at the start of each test.

**Acceptance criteria and performance:**

- **Cell morphology:** Cells should be oval and form neuronal networks after differentiation.  
- **Confluency:** Approximately 80% confluence at the time of seeding.  
- **Adherence and health:** Cells should be adherent and show healthy morphology, with no signs of detachment or excessive cell death.  
- **Contamination:** No contamination should be present.  
- **Reproducibility:** When performing differentiation 10 times, the average confluency should be around 80%, with a variation (standard deviation) typically within ±10%.  
- **Actions if criteria are not met:** Discard the culture if contamination is detected, if confluency is too low or too high, or if morphology indicates unhealthy cells. For example, if viability or adherence is compromised, the culture should be replaced.

However, it lacks clarity and completeness in some areas. It does not explicitly mention critical handling steps, positive and negative controls, or provide specific recommendations to increase reproducibility. The answer could be improved by including these missing elements and providing more detailed guidance on handling and control measures.","The known causes of variability for the final test system state include several critical factors:

Critical consumables or batch effects:
- Plastic coating quality (e.g., batches of PLO and fibronectin) can influence cell distribution and adherence, leading to clumping or uneven growth.
- Variability between plates and flasks from different suppliers or lots may affect cell attachment and growth.
- Batch effects of media and supplements, such as FCS or serum replacements, can alter cell behavior and differentiation efficiency.
- Variations in coating procedures, such as water quality or coating duration, can impact cell distribution.

Critical handling steps and influencing factors:
- Proper coating of plates and flasks is essential; insufficient or inconsistent coating can cause uneven cell growth.
- Cell density at seeding must be carefully controlled; too high or too low density can impair metabolism, differentiation, or cause autocrine proliferation stimulation.
- During medium changes and seeding, rapid and precise pipetting is necessary to avoid cell stress or uneven distribution.
- Cells should be handled at appropriate passage numbers (e.g., up to passage 18) to prevent altered behavior due to drift.
- Maintaining consistent confluency (40–90%) is crucial; over-confluency impairs metabolism, under-confluency affects differentiation.

Controls and expected values:
- Negative controls: solvent (0.1% DMSO) should not significantly alter OCR or mitochondrial parameters.
- Positive controls: known mitochondrial toxicants or inhibitors (e.g., rotenone, antimycin A) should produce characteristic decreases in OCR and specific complex activity impairments.
- Deviations: within-test variation should be minimal; for example, OCR responses to controls should be consistent across repeats, with acceptable deviations typically within ±10–15%. Between repeats, similar consistency is expected, with deviations not exceeding 20%.

Recommendations to increase/ensure reproducibility:
- Use validated, consistent batches of coating reagents and media.
- Standardize coating procedures, including water quality and incubation times.
- Limit passage number of cells and use cells from the same batch for a series of experiments.
- Perform cell seeding and medium changes swiftly and uniformly, ideally by trained operators.
- Regularly verify cell morphology, confluency, and adherence before experiments.
- Include internal controls (solvent, known mitochondrial toxicants) in each run to monitor assay performance.
- Document all handling steps meticulously, including cell density, passage number, and reagent lot numbers.
- Conduct periodic inter-laboratory comparisons or ring trials to benchmark performance.
- Implement strict SOPs for coating, cell handling, and assay execution to minimize operator-dependent variability.

**Overall Cell Culture Timeline:**

- **Day -1:**  
  - Proliferating LUHMES cells are seeded in proliferation medium (e.g., Advanced DMEM/F12 + supplements).  
  - Cells are cultured until they reach approximately 80% confluency, with minimal cell death and no contamination.  

- **Day 0:**  
  - Medium is changed from proliferation medium to differentiation medium (containing tetracycline, GDNF, and db-cAMP).  
  - Cells begin differentiation into dopaminergic neurons.  

- **Day 2:**  
  - Cells reach about 20-30 million per T75 flask.  
  - Cells are trypsinized and re-plated onto coated Seahorse XF24-well plates at **100,000 cells/well** in 100 µl of differentiation medium (without supplements).  
  - After 1 hour of attachment, **additional medium (500 µl)** is added to each well to ensure proper volume and cell health.  

- **Day 3 (Assay Day):**  
  - **Medium change:**  
    - The medium is replaced with Seahorse assay medium (Seahorse XF DMEM, pH 7.4), supplemented with **1 mM pyruvate**, **2 mM glutamine**, and **18 mM glucose or galactose** (if galactose condition is used).  
    - **Critical supplements:**  
      - **ADP** (to support mitochondrial activity) and **digitonin** (to permeabilize cells if needed) are added freshly to the assay medium immediately before measurement.  
  - **Compound addition:**  
    - Test compounds are loaded into the Seahorse cartridge ports at desired concentrations (diluted in assay medium with 1% DMSO).  
    - Sequential injections during the assay include:  
      - **Test compound** (to assess acute effects)  
      - **Tool compounds** (e.g., oligomycin, FCCP, rotenone/antimycin A) for mitochondrial stress profiling.  
  - **Measurement:**  
    - OCR is measured before and after each injection to assess basal respiration, response to compounds, and mitochondrial parameters.  
    - **Sampling:**  
      - Nuclei are stained with Hoechst (H-33342) after OCR measurement for cell counting and normalization.  

**Key Points & Critical Medium Supplements:**

- **Coating:**  
  - Plates are coated overnight with poly-L-ornithine and fibronectin before seeding.  
- **Medium Supplements:**  
  - During proliferation: FGF, N2 supplement.  
  - During differentiation: tetracycline (1 µg/ml), GDNF (2 ng/ml), db-cAMP (1 mM).  
  - During assay: Seahorse assay medium with pyruvate, glutamine, glucose/galactose, ADP, digitonin.  
- **Medium Changes & Compound Re-addition:**  
  - Medium is changed on Day 0 (to initiate differentiation) and on Day 3 (before assay).  
  - **Compounds are only re-added if medium is changed**; during the assay, compounds are injected sequentially via the Seahorse cartridge.  
- **Cell Re-plating:**  
  - Cells are trypsinized and re-plated onto Seahorse plates on Day 2, ensuring even distribution and proper confluency for the assay.

Additionally, it does not explain the quantification algorithm or how semi-quantitative estimates are obtained, which are crucial for a complete understanding of the method.","The assay is based on measuring mitochondrial respiration parameters in human dopaminergic LUHMES neurons using a Seahorse XF Analyzer. The key steps involve culturing and differentiating LUHMES cells into mature neurons, then re-plating them onto coated Seahorse XF microplates. Prior to measurement, the cells are incubated in Seahorse assay medium, which is supplemented with substrates and inhibitors specific to mitochondrial function. Test compounds are added directly into the assay medium, and mitochondrial activity is assessed by sequential injections of mitochondrial stress test reagents, including oligomycin, FCCP, and rotenone/antimycin A, to evaluate various parameters such as basal respiration, ATP production, proton leak, maximal respiration, and spare capacity. 

The primary measurement is the oxygen consumption rate (OCR), which reflects mitochondrial respiration. The assay also includes a parallel measurement of extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), indicating glycolytic activity, although the main focus is on OCR-derived parameters. 

For endpoints, the assay quantifies several mitochondrial parameters: basal respiration, ATP-coupled respiration, proton leak, maximal respiration, respiratory spare capacity, and non-mitochondrial respiration. These are calculated from OCR data obtained after specific injections of stress reagents. 

Imaging is used to determine cell number via nuclei staining with Hoechst H-33342. The nuclei are imaged in multiple fields (roughly 25 per well), and nuclei are identified based on size, shape, and intensity. The cell count is used to normalize OCR data, ensuring that mitochondrial activity is expressed per cell. 

All measurements are performed in the same wells under identical conditions, with OCR and nuclei imaging conducted sequentially. The quantification algorithm involves image analysis software that detects nuclei based on predefined parameters, enabling automated cell counting. The OCR data are normalized to the cell number, allowing for accurate comparison across samples.",0.7820737974302445,0.1269468069076538,0.14243508875370026,0.13811556994915009

The expected data on such negative controls should show no significant change in the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) or other mitochondrial parameters compared to baseline, with the signal reflecting the background noise or variability inherent to the assay. The uncertainty or variability of the negative control signal is not explicitly quantified but is based on visual inspection and the natural variation observed in multiple measurements, serving as the baseline for detecting significant effects (Source: EFSA Journal 2023:7794).

The rationale for the concentration setting of the negative control (0.1% DMSO) is to match the solvent concentration used in test conditions, ensuring that any observed effects are due to the test compounds and not the solvent itself. This concentration is chosen because it is generally considered non-toxic and does not interfere with mitochondrial function at this level (Source: EFSA Journal 2023:7794).

Yes, unspecific controls are used, specifically the solvent DMSO at 0.1%. The rationale for its use is to account for any effects caused by the solvent vehicle rather than the test compounds, establishing a baseline for normal mitochondrial activity.

However, it lacks details on the time plan establishment, adherence to plate maps, routine procedures for documenting intermediate steps, and the specific format (DB-ALM) for SOPs. The response is incomplete and lacks clarity on several aspects of the question.","The time plan of pipetting is established prior to the experiment by defining the sequence and timing of all pipetting steps, including cell seeding, medium changes, compound addition, and reagent injections. This plan is documented in the plate maps and metadata files before starting the procedure. During pipetting, operators follow the predefined pattern, typically performing steps in a systematic, left-to-right, top-to-bottom order to ensure consistency and minimize errors.

Adherence to plate maps during pipetting is documented through real-time recording of any deviations or errors directly in the lab notebook and on the plate maps. Any issues such as incorrect well assignment, missed wells, or pipetting errors are marked immediately on the map and in the procedural notes.

Routine procedures for documenting intermediate steps, potential errors, mistakes, and uncertainties include:
- Recording all pipetting actions, including volumes and times, in the lab notebook.
- Marking any deviations from the protocol, such as pipetting twice in one well, on the plate map and in the experiment log.
- Noting any technical problems encountered (e.g., focus failure, outliers in imaging, or pipetting inconsistencies).
- Documenting environmental conditions and operator notes that could influence results.

Errors like pipetting twice in one well are explicitly recorded by marking the well on the plate map and noting the mistake in the procedural log. These wells are typically excluded from data analysis or flagged during data processing.

The wells are used sequentially following a pattern that minimizes cross-contamination and systematic bias, often in a row-wise or column-wise manner, depending on the experimental design. For example, the pattern may proceed row-by-row from well A1 to A12, then B1 to B12, and so forth, or column-by-column, ensuring that each condition or concentration is assigned systematically.

The concentration steps can range between 1:2 and 1:10 serial dilutions, depending on the expected potency and the specific endpoint being measured (Source: section 6.4). 

There is no strict universal rule for the starting dilutions; instead, the initial concentration is usually chosen based on prior knowledge of the compound’s activity, solubility, and toxicity profile. The goal is to include a broad enough range to capture potential effects, including sub-toxic and toxic levels, to enable concentration-response analysis.

For endpoints that do not produce a full concentration-response curve—such as gene expression or mechanistic endpoints like EC10 of viability—test concentrations are often selected based on preliminary data or known activity thresholds. For example, the EC10 or other relevant effect levels derived from viability or other functional data can guide the choice of test concentrations to ensure mechanistic relevance without causing overt cytotoxicity.

Describe all processing steps from background correction (e.g. measurement of medium control) to normalization steps (e.g. if you relate treated samples to untreated controls).","a) Cellomics normalization data - Array Scan VTI HCS Reader (Cellomics, PA) takes images (optionally bitmap or tiff-format; 512 x 512 pixels, 8bit or 16bit) - Images are locally analyzed using the Array Scan software, the algorithm quantifies cell count (nuclei) - Data are copy-pasted into an Excel sheet, further analysis is done with Excel. b) Seahorse metabolic data - Seahorse XF Analyzer records oxygen levels and pH. OCR and ECAR are calculated directly. These readouts are saved with the meta data (.asyr format) - For further evaluation, the Seahorse metabolic data is uploaded to Seahorse Analytics (https://seahorseanalytics.agilent.com/Account/Login) - Cellomics normalization data is imported and applied - Artefacts and outliers are excluded (see 4.3) - Endpoints are automatically calculated by the pre-set “XF Cell Mito Stress Test” Assay Kit Companion View - Data can then be extracted as Excel files or GraphPad Prism files.

However, it lacks specific details on background correction, normalization steps, and how summary data like EC50 or PoD are derived. The description is somewhat fragmented and does not fully address the question's request for a comprehensive step-by-step process.","The raw data processing in this assay involves several steps to derive summary data such as EC50, BMC15, ratios, or PoD. First, the raw data and metadata are obtained from the Seahorse XF Analyzer, where oxygen levels and pH are recorded, and OCR and ECAR are calculated directly (Source: 7.1). All OCR values are then normalized to the last measurement before compound injection to account for baseline differences (Source: 7.3). 

Subsequently, artefacts and outliers are excluded based on visual inspection, as mathematical outlier detection has not been explicitly defined (Source: 7.2). The normalized OCR values after each injection are used to calculate specific endpoints, such as basal respiration, ATP production, proton leak, maximal respiration, spare capacity, and non-mitochondrial respiration, by comparing the OCR after treatment to the appropriate controls (Source: 5.3). 

For example, the basal respiration is calculated as OCR (test compound) minus OCR (Rotenone & Antimycin A), and the acute response to the test compound is the difference between OCR (test compound) and OCR (basal). These values are then used to generate concentration-response curves, which are fitted using nonlinear regression (least squares) to derive parameters like EC50 or BMCs (Source: 7.4). 

All data are stored on the analysis computers and exported to further analysis platforms, with metadata documented accordingly (Sources: 7.5, 7.6). This systematic approach ensures that background effects are corrected, and data are normalized relative to untreated controls, enabling accurate derivation of summary metrics such as EC50, BMC15, or other PoD indicators.",0.7348632366903569,0.12395455688238144,0.046376168727874756,0.08755641430616379

For the concentration curve, a nonlinear regression fit is calculated. The fitting method is least squares. If a non-linear curve fit is not possible, a linear curve fit is performed. The curve deriving from the fit is a 4-parameter log function. Treated concentrations are analyzed for deviation from control. Sometimes it is analyzed whether the deviation of neurite growth is different from the deviation of viability. This is done by two-way ANOVA + Tukey-Kramer post hoc testing.

However, it lacks clarity and completeness in linking the test method data to specific in vivo adverse outcomes and does not explicitly mention the toxicological events or specific human adverse outcomes related to the test method.","The test methods (MitoStressLUHMES assay (MSL), MitoComplexesLUHMES assay (MCL)) are designed to assess mitochondrial function in human dopaminergic neurons, which are relevant to neurotoxicity and neurodegenerative processes. The scientific rationale for linking the data to in vivo adverse outcomes is based on the central role of mitochondrial impairment in neuronal health and function, particularly in dopaminergic neurons of the central nervous system. Disruptions in mitochondrial respiration and complex activity can lead to neuronal dysfunction, degeneration, and ultimately neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (Source: EFSA Journal 2023:7794).

The toxicological target modeled by these assays is the mitochondria within human dopaminergic neurons, reflecting the organ and tissue level (central nervous system, specifically the substantia nigra region). The assays model key biological processes such as mitochondrial respiration, including basal respiration, ATP production, proton leak, and activity of individual mitochondrial respiratory complexes (Sources: EFSA Journal 2023:7794).

The toxicological events reflected by these methods include impairment of mitochondrial respiration, inhibition of mitochondrial complexes, and potential downstream effects such as energy deficiency, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These events can contribute to neuronal stress, dysfunction, and cell death pathways (Source: EFSA Journal 2023:7794).

These assays are related to adverse outcomes such as neurodegeneration, neurotoxicity, and Parkinsonian motor deficits in humans. They potentially predict hazards associated with mitochondrial toxicants that may impair neuronal mitochondrial function, leading to neurodegenerative diseases or developmental neurotoxicity (Sources: EFSA Journal 2023:7794).",0.7501348704828514,0.20469029247760773,-0.0019136330811306834,0.09596039354801178

"Indicate whether the test method has been or could be linked to an AOP (or several AOPs) and in which form (e.g. test of KE activation). Can the test method cover an AOP MIE/KE? Reference relevant AOP and if in AOP-wiki, refer to status.",Test method could be potentially linked to the following AOPs in AOPwiki:  AOP 3: Inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I of nigra-striatal neurons leads to parkinsonian motor deficits. → Organ effects: degeneration of DA neurons of nigrostriatal pathway,Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by mentioning a potential link to AOP 3 and describing the organ effects. However, it lacks clarity on whether the test method covers an AOP MIE/KE and does not reference the status of the AOP in AOP-wiki.","The test method could potentially be linked to the AOP 3: ""Inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I of nigrostriatal neurons leads to parkinsonian motor deficits"" in the AOPwiki. This AOP involves the key event (KE) of mitochondrial complex I inhibition, which is directly assessed by the MitoComplexesLUHMES (MCL) assay through measurement of activity in individual mitochondrial complexes (Source: EFSA Case Study, Assay descriptions). The assay measures the activity of mitochondrial complexes I-IV, thus it can serve as a test of KE activation related to mitochondrial complex inhibition, which is a key event (KE) in this AOP. 

The status of this linkage in the AOPwiki is that it is a potential connection; the assay's mechanistic focus on mitochondrial complex activity aligns with the KE of complex I inhibition, making it relevant for mechanistic understanding within this AOP framework. However, formal validation of this linkage has not been performed, and the assay is not officially integrated into the AOP framework for regulatory purposes (Source: EFSA Case Study).",0.7794235926941482,0.2585464417934418,-0.020353423431515694,0.10639505833387375
