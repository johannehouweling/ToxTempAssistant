The absence of a scheme or graphical representation limits the completeness of the response.","The assay described, cMINC (UKN2), utilizes human neural crest cells (NCCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). The differentiation protocol from iPSCs to NCCs involves several phases, media, substrates, and manipulation steps, which are summarized below:

**Differentiation Scheme and Phases:**

1. **Plating of iPSCs:**  
   - iPSCs (IMR90 clone #4) are plated on Matrigel-coated 6-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells/cm² in Essential 8 (E8) medium containing 10 μM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 to promote survival and attachment.  
   - Cells grow in colonies and reach 80–100% confluency within one day.

2. **Initiation of Differentiation (Day 0):**  
   - Medium is changed to KSR medium (Knockout DMEM with serum replacement, GlutaMax, NEAA, 2-mercaptoethanol).  
   - Supplemented with 20 ng/ml Noggin and 10 μM SB431542 to promote neural crest lineage specification.  
   - Cells are treated with these factors for 2 days.

3. **Patterning and Induction (Days 2–4):**  
   - From Day 2, cells are treated with 3 μM CHIR99021 to activate Wnt signaling, supporting NCC induction.  
   - Noggin and SB431542 are withdrawn at Days 3 and 4, respectively.

4. **Transition to N2-S Medium (Days 4–11):**  
   - Gradual medium change from KSR to N2-S medium (a defined medium with glucose, GlutaMax, apotransferin, insulin, progesterone, putrescine, selenium).  
   - Medium is replaced in 25% increments daily, starting at Day 4, until fully transitioned by Day 11.

5. **Expansion and Seeding (Days 11–35/39):**  
   - Cells are collected at Day 11, resuspended in N2-S medium supplemented with EGF and FGF2, and seeded as droplets (10 μl) onto poly-L-ornithine (PLO)/Laminin/Fibronectin coated dishes.  
   - Cells are expanded by weekly splitting, with medium changes every second day.

6. **Cryopreservation:**  
   - After 35–39 days, NCCs are cryopreserved at 4×10^6 cells/ml in N2-S medium with 10% DMSO.

**Substrates and Interaction with Matrix:**

- The final NCCs are seeded on coated substrates: poly-L-ornithine, Laminin, and Fibronectin, which support adhesion, migration, and mimic aspects of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in vivo.

**Manipulation Steps:**

- **Medium Changes:**  
  - Regular medium changes are performed during differentiation, with gradual medium transition from KSR to N2-S medium.  
  - During expansion, medium is changed every second day.

- **Cell Seeding:**  
  - Cells are seeded as droplets on coated dishes, allowing self-aggregation and organization into a migratory monolayer.

- **Cryopreservation:**  
  - Cells are frozen at the end of differentiation for storage and subsequent use.

**Special Requirements for Microphysiological Systems and Organoids:**

- The protocol emphasizes the importance of cell–matrix interactions, as cells are seeded on ECM-coated substrates to facilitate adhesion and migration.  
- For organoid or microphysiological system development, additional steps such as cell printing, self-aggregation, or self-organization may be necessary, although not explicitly detailed here.  
- Geometrical characterization (size, shape) of cell clusters or organoids can be performed to assess uniformity and reproducibility.  
- Interaction with the matrix is critical, as the ECM components influence cell behavior, migration, and differentiation pathways.

Are there subpopulations that are generally more sensitive to cytotoxicity than others, and could this influence viability measures? Is it known whether specific chemicals/chemical classes show differential cytotoxicity for the cell sub-populations used?","A highly homogeneous pre-differentiated population of neural crest cells is added to coated wells. In the middle of the well is a silicone stopper that prevents cells from settling in a circular area in the middle of the well. The cells are kept viable and alive by the presence of EGF and FGF in the medium, and they become adherent overnight. When the stopper is removed, the cells form a dense monolayer in the culture dish, with a sharply demarcated circular area in the middle that is free of cells. Due to their natural spontaneous migration behaviour, the cells move into the cell-free area. The cells are still in a proliferative state. Proliferation at the edge of the cell free area contributes to a small extent to “apparent migration behaviour”. This has been characterized and quantified in detail (Nyffeler et al. 2016). It is accounted for by counting cells in a narrower circle than the original circular area.",Medium,"The answer provides a detailed description of the test system, including the culture protocol and cell behavior. However, it lacks information on the percentage of contaminating cells, the percentage of each subpopulation in co-cultures, and whether specific chemicals show differential cytotoxicity for the cell sub-populations used. These omissions prevent a 'High' score.","The assay uses human neural crest cells (NCCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The differentiation process involves several steps: starting from undifferentiated hiPSCs maintained on Laminin-521 in E8 medium, cells are plated on Matrigel-coated plates and induced to differentiate into NCCs following a modified protocol based on Mica et al. (2013). During differentiation, cells are treated with specific growth factors and signaling molecules, such as Noggin, SB431542, CHIR99021, EGF, and FGF2, over a period of approximately 35-39 days, culminating in a highly homogeneous population of NCCs.

The derived NCCs are characterized by expressing typical NCC markers (HNK-1, p75, nestin, AP2) and lack expression of markers for other cell types such as GFAP, Pax6, and βIII tubulin, indicating a predominantly NCC phenotype. The cells are maintained as a monolayer on coated surfaces (PLO/Laminin/Fibronectin) and are kept viable with growth factors (EGF and FGF2). They are cryopreserved at a concentration of 4×10^6 cells/ml in N2-S medium with DMSO until use.

In the test system, NCCs are seeded as a highly homogeneous population (>90% positive for NCC markers) into wells with a silicone stopper creating a circular cell-free zone. After attachment, the stopper is removed, allowing cells to migrate into the free area, which models in vivo NCC migration. The assay measures the impairment of migration and cell viability after exposure to test compounds.

Regarding contamination and subpopulations, the NCC cultures are characterized to be ≥90% positive for NCC markers, indicating minimal contamination with other cell types. The protocol does not specify the presence of other subpopulations or their proportions, but the high purity suggests that the culture is predominantly NCCs. There is no detailed information on whether specific subpopulations within NCCs show differential sensitivity to cytotoxicity; however, since the cultures are highly homogeneous, the influence of subpopulation sensitivity on viability measures is likely minimal.

As for differential cytotoxicity among chemical classes, the document does not specify whether certain chemicals or classes preferentially affect subpopulations within NCCs. The assay primarily assesses overall migration impairment and viability of the NCC population as a whole, and the high homogeneity of the cells used reduces the likelihood of subpopulation-specific effects influencing the overall viability measures.",0.6605110180921907,0.2072174996137619,0.01895442046225071,0.10922128707170486

It lacks detail and completeness required to fully address the question.","The acceptance criteria for the cMINC (UKN2) assay's source cells focus on ensuring the quality and consistency of the neural crest cell (NCC) population used in the test. The key endpoints and parameters include:

- **Expression of NCC markers:** The cells must be ≥ 90% positive for the NCC markers HNK-1 and p75, as confirmed by FACS analysis and immunofluorescence labeling (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf).
- **Pathogen-free status:** Cells must be free of pathogens, including mycoplasma, verified through regular testing (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf).
- **Viability after thawing:** Viability should be > 90% immediately after thawing (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf).
- **Differentiation and characterization:** The cells should express pluripotency markers (Oct4, Nanog, Tra-1-60) prior to differentiation, and after differentiation, they should exhibit typical NCC marker expression and morphology, with ≥ 90% positivity for HNK-1 and p75 (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf).

**Historical performance and variation:**
- The source cells are maintained up to 10 passages, with high consistency in marker expression and viability.
- Variability between plates within a single experiment is lower than 5%, and between different experiments is lower than 20% (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf).
- When differentiation is performed 10 times, the average expression of NCC markers (HNK-1 and p75) remains ≥ 90%, with a variation typically within ±5–10%. Cell viability consistently exceeds 90%.

**Actions if acceptance criteria are not met:**
- Cells showing less than 90% marker expression or viability are discarded.
- Differentiation batches with marker expression below the threshold are not used for testing.
- If cell morphology or marker expression indicates spontaneous differentiation or contamination, the batch is rejected and replaced.

This can decrease number of viable cells after thawing.,Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by mentioning some causes of variability such as high passage number, cell density, and handling during freeze and thaw processes. However, it lacks details on critical consumables, batch effects, specific handling steps, controls, expected values, and recommendations for reproducibility and performance.","The known causes of variability for the final test system state in the cMINC (UKN2) assay include several factors related to cell maintenance, differentiation, handling, and assay execution. Critical consumables and batch effects encompass batch effects of critical additives such as holo-transferrin and TGF-β, which can influence cell differentiation and performance. Variability can also arise from differences in plate format and supplier, as well as from batch effects of fetal calf serum (FCS) or serum replacements used during cell culture.

Critical handling steps and influencing factors include:
- Maintaining cells at low passage numbers (up to 10 passages) to prevent performance decline.
- Ensuring proper cell density at seeding (80–100% confluency) during differentiation; too low or too high density can cause detachment or spontaneous differentiation.
- Handling of cells during thawing and freezing, where rapid processing is essential to preserve viability (>90%) and prevent DMSO toxicity.
- Precise pipetting, especially during compound addition, as errors can lead to variability in exposure concentrations.
- Performing medium changes and compound additions swiftly to minimize time cells spend at room temperature, which can affect cell viability and behavior.
- Consistent coating procedures and well handling to prevent edge effects, with inner wells used for testing.

Positive controls (e.g., cytochalasin D, LiCl, taxol) are expected to inhibit migration significantly, with migration reduced to ≤75% of control, and viability >90%. Negative controls (solvent DMSO, paracetamol, ASS) should show no significant inhibition, with migration >80% of control and viability >90%. Deviations beyond these thresholds (e.g., negative control decreasing migration by ≥10%) may lead to test discard.

Recommendations to increase reproducibility and performance include:
- Using well-characterized, consistent batches of critical additives and reagents.
- Limiting cell passage number and verifying pluripotency markers regularly.
- Standardizing cell seeding density and differentiation protocols.
- Ensuring rapid and precise pipetting, with operator training to minimize technical variability.
- Including internal controls in each run and monitoring their responses to detect assay drift.
- Performing assay runs with multiple replicates and normalizing data to untreated controls.
- Documenting all handling steps meticulously and adhering to SOPs.
- Regularly calibrating and maintaining imaging equipment to ensure consistent image quality.

- **Medium changes:** The medium is replaced at Day 0 after initial cell attachment and at the start of the migration phase. During the compound exposure (Day 1), no medium change occurs; compounds are added directly to the existing medium.

- **Compound re-addition:** Compounds are only added once at Day 1; they are not re-added after medium changes, as the exposure duration is 24 hours.

- **Critical medium supplements:** EGF and FGF are maintained in the medium throughout the migration phase to sustain cell viability and migration capacity.

- **Cell culture context:** Cells are freshly seeded around the silicone stoppers on Day -1, ensuring they are in a proliferative, migratory state at the start of exposure. The assay duration from Day 0 to Day 2 is 24 hours of compound exposure.

The expected data for these negative controls should show normal migration of NCCs into the cell-free area and viability greater than 90%, with minimal variation, typically within a 6% coefficient of variation for intra-experimental baseline (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf). These controls establish the background signal and noise level of the test method, providing a reference for detecting significant migration inhibition or toxicity.

The rationale for the concentration setting of negative controls is to use the solvent at the highest concentration used in test conditions (0.1% DMSO) to ensure that the solvent itself does not interfere with cell migration or viability. This concentration is chosen because it is generally considered non-toxic and non-inhibitory to cell migration, serving as a baseline for comparison.

The serial dilutions are prepared in a separate deepwell plate, with 25 µl transferred to the assay plates, ensuring a consistent and reproducible concentration gradient (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf). The highest concentration is chosen based on the solubility and cytotoxicity considerations of the compound, and the serial dilution is performed to generate a concentration-response curve.

Regarding the rule for defining starting dilutions, the protocol recommends a serial dilution starting from a concentration that is sufficiently high to observe potential effects without causing non-specific toxicity, with a typical dilution factor of 1:3. The exact starting concentration can be adapted depending on the compound's solubility and known activity.

To calculate the EC25 value, this log-function is solved for y=25% of the total scale, not for 25% of the min-max scale (see example below). Treated concentrations are analyzed for deviation from control. Sometimes it is analyzed whether the deviation of neurite growth is different from the deviation of viability via comparison of the means ± deviation using two-way ANOVA + Tukey-Kramer post hoc testing. Significance levels of data points compared to solvent control are determined via one-way ANOVA followed with non-parametric Dunnett’s post test.

Impaired NCC migration triggered genetically or by toxicants can lead to malformations and disorders e.g. Hirschsprung’s disease or Treacher- Collins syndrome. The cMINC assay models the effects of NCC migration under toxicant exposure. The test captures endpoints like spina bifida or cleft palate also measured during developmental toxicity regulatory studies.,Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by identifying the biological process (NCC migration) and some adverse outcomes (Hirschsprung’s disease, Treacher-Collins syndrome, spina bifida, cleft palate). However, it lacks clarity and completeness in linking the test method data to specific in vivo adverse outcomes, specifying the toxicological target, and detailing the toxicological events modeled. The potential hazards predicted by the test method are not explicitly mentioned.","The assay models the impairment of human neural crest cell (NCC) migration, a critical process during fetal development. The scientific rationale for linking test data to in vivo adverse outcomes is based on the role of NCC migration in proper development of structures such as the craniofacial region and neural tube. Disruptions in NCC migration can lead to developmental disorders and malformations, including neural tube defects and craniofacial abnormalities (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf).

The toxicological target modeled by this assay is the developing neural crest tissue, which contributes to craniofacial structures, peripheral nervous system, and other tissues derived from NCCs.

The biological processes reflected by this test method include NCC migration and associated cellular behaviors such as cell motility, cytoskeletal reorganization, and proliferation. The assay specifically measures the ability of NCCs to migrate into a cell-free zone, thus modeling the migration process during fetal development (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf).

Toxicological events modeled by the assay include disturbances in cell migration, which may result from toxicant-induced cytoskeletal disruption, and cell viability, which is measured to distinguish migration-specific effects from general cytotoxicity (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf).

The assay is related to adverse outcomes such as craniofacial malformations, neural tube defects, and other developmental disorders caused by impaired NCC migration during fetal development. It potentially predicts hazards associated with compounds that interfere with cell migration processes critical for normal embryogenesis (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf).",0.8461073494773785,0.26198285818099976,0.07339435815811157,0.16390696167945862

Several performance parameters for the test were obtained in several separate evaluation rounds. A first evaluation was done during the first publication of the model and its applications (Nyffeler et al. 2016). Here, a panel of well-selected positive and negative controls have been tested. Accordingly, the specificity was 100% and the sensitivity was > 90 %. In dedicated experiments, S/N ratios of > 20 and a z’ of > 0.5 have been determined. The compound used as positive control cytochalasin D was run across 35 different assay plates. The migration percentage relative to the solvent control varied between 30 and 70% across all plates (Nyffeler et al. 2016, Supplementary S2). Later, the test has been used in screening campaigns, and real-live performance data under broader screen conditions have been obtained. The different performance data need to be considered, when a compound is a hit in a screen, or whether it has been specifically evaluated in a hit follow-up or a mechanistic project. A first screen application has been the NTP80 screen (80 compounds provided by the US NTP). Data are published in Nyffeler et al. 2017. A second screen application has been the cross systems case study of the EU-ToxRisk project. The baseline variation is indicated in Krebs et al., 2020. Moreover, an overview is given for 19 compounds on the BMC/BMCL ratio as measure of readout certainty. A third screen was performed in the context of the EFSA DNT test battery evaluation with 120 compounds (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). From this screen the following performance indicators were obtained: A: Specificity of DNT IVB: 100% → Also with cMINC as standalone assay in 17 `tool negatives´ tested (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). B: Sensitivity of DNT IVB: 82.7% → With cMINC combined in a full DNT battery and a selected set of 27 positive compounds with evidence for DNT (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). C: Baseline variation (intra-experimental) Migration: 14.8 ± 4.3% Cell viability: 6 ± 3% D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) Migration: 15.6% Cell viability: 9.7% E: Variation of a positive control run on each (inter-experimental) Migration: 32.2% Definition of values C-E C: Baseline variation (intra-experimental) is the mean coefficient of variation CV±SD of the CV of all replicates of the solvent control from each experiment across n>200 experiments. D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) is the variability across all independent experiments (n>200) after normalization based on the response of the lowest test concentration. It was assumed that the lowest test concentration does not affect any of the endpoints measured. E: Variation of a positive control run on each (inter-experimental) is the variability of the positive control across all independent experiments (n>40) after normalization. Example for a positive control that on average reduced the specific endpoint down to 40% (relative to solvent control) and a calculated variability of 50%: 0.5 x 40% = +/- 20% → The positive control with mean of 40% varies from 20% to 60%.",High,"The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the test method's performance parameters, including specificity, sensitivity, signal/noise ratio, z-factor, baseline variation, and inter-operator variations.

However, it lacks clarity and completeness regarding potential restrictions, comparison to similar tests, and specific gaps it fills in a test battery. It also does not clearly indicate whether the test should be used in the first tier or later tiers.","Yes, the cMINC (UKN2) assay can be incorporated into a test battery. It has been considered as part of the ESNA TS (Embryonic Stem cell -based Novel Alternative Testing Strategies) screen battery, which aims to assess developmental neurotoxicity hazards of chemicals (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf). 

Strengths of the system within a test battery include its medium throughput capability, automated microscopy, and its ability to provide mechanistic insights into neural crest cell migration impairment, which is relevant for developmental toxicity. It is particularly useful as a screening tool and for mechanistic follow-up, especially since it models a critical process during fetal development and can predict developmental disorders such as neural tube defects or craniofacial malformations (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf). 

Weaknesses include the lack of formal validation and ring-trial data, which limits its regulatory acceptance. Additionally, it is not yet fully established as a stand-alone regulatory test, and its applicability domain is limited to water-soluble compounds, excluding volatile or poorly soluble substances (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf).

Compared to similar migration assays, such as the scratch assay, the cMINC assay offers higher throughput and automation, making it more suitable for screening large chemical libraries. Its performance parameters, such as sensitivity (>90%) and specificity (100%), are promising, although these are based on initial validation efforts rather than extensive ring-trial validation (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf).

The assay fills a gap in the battery by providing a human cell-based, mechanistically relevant endpoint for neural crest migration, a key process in development. It complements other assays that assess general cytotoxicity, neurotoxicity, or specific signaling pathways, thereby strengthening the overall battery's ability to predict developmental neurotoxicity.

Regarding its placement in testing strategies, the cMINC assay is best suited as a first-tier screening tool due to its medium throughput and mechanistic relevance. Positive hits can then be followed up with more detailed, higher-tier assays, including in vivo studies or additional in vitro tests assessing other developmental endpoints. It is not recommended as a stand-alone method for regulatory decision-making but as part of an integrated testing battery with complementary assays for comprehensive hazard assessment.",0.685212495864273,0.250715434551239,-0.0041417209431529045,0.11329877376556396
