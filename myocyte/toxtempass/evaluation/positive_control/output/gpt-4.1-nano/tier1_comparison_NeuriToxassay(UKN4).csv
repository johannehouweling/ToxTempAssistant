However, it lacks a graphical overview and does not fully address special/additional requirements for microphysiological systems and organoids, such as cell printing or interaction with the matrix. The explanation is somewhat fragmented and could be more cohesive.","The differentiation protocol for the NeuriTox assay involves a two-step process to generate mature dopaminergic neurons from LUHMES cells, which are initially maintained in a proliferative precursor state and then differentiated into neurons with neuronal network formation. 

**Scheme and Phases:**

- **Proliferation Phase (Day -1):**  
  LUHMES cells are seeded in proliferation medium containing N2 supplement and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). This phase ensures expansion of precursor cells.

- **Initiation of Differentiation (Day 0):**  
  The medium is changed from proliferation medium to differentiation medium, which contains tetracycline, GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor), and dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP). Tetracycline suppresses v-myc expression, promoting exit from proliferation and initiation of differentiation.

- **Differentiation and Re-plating (Day 2):**  
  After 2 days of differentiation, cells reach about 30-40 million per T175 flask. They are trypsinized and re-plated onto coated 96-well plates at a density of 30,000 cells per well in differentiation medium without GDNF and cAMP. This step facilitates neurite outgrowth and network formation.

- **Toxicant Exposure (Day 2-3):**  
  Approximately 30 minutes to 2 hours after re-plating, test compounds are added. Cells are then incubated with the compounds for 24 hours.

- **Readout (Day 3):**  
  After 24 hours of exposure, cells are stained and imaged to assess neurite outgrowth and viability.

**Media and Substrates:**

- **Coating:**  
  Plates and flasks are coated overnight with poly-L-ornithine (PLO) and fibronectin to promote cell attachment and neurite extension. The coating is washed with PBS or MilliQ water and dried under sterile conditions.

- **Media:**  
  - *Proliferation medium:* contains N2 supplement and bFGF.  
  - *Differentiation medium:* DMEM/F12 Advanced, supplemented with tetracycline, GDNF, and db-cAMP during initial differentiation; GDNF and cAMP are omitted during re-plating.

**Manipulation Steps:**

- **Medium Change:**  
  Transition from proliferation to differentiation medium at Day 0.

- **Re-plating:**  
  Cells are trypsinized at Day 2 and re-plated onto coated 96-well plates for the assay.

- **Compound Addition:**  
  Test compounds are added 30 min to 2 h after re-plating in differentiation medium.

- **Incubation:**  
  Cells are incubated with compounds for 24 hours before staining and imaging.

**Special Requirements for Microphysiological Systems:**

- The protocol is designed for 2D monolayer cultures; however, for advanced systems like organoids or 3D cultures, additional steps such as cell printing, self-aggregation, or interaction with extracellular matrix components may be necessary. These include:

  - *Self-aggregation or self-organization:*  
    Cells may be allowed to form 3D structures via spontaneous aggregation or controlled self-assembly.

  - *Interaction with matrix:*  
    Embedding cells within or on top of a 3D matrix (e.g., Matrigel, collagen) to mimic tissue architecture.

  - *Geometrical characterization:*  
    Size and shape of organoids or 3D constructs are monitored to ensure reproducibility and proper development.

These additional steps require precise control over cell seeding density, matrix composition, and culture conditions to support tissue-like organization and function, which are beyond the scope of the basic protocol but are critical for microphysiological systems and organoid applications.",0.8408829437223485,0.24852466583251953,0.052718453109264374,0.14624424278736115

However, it lacks information on the general features/principles of the culture protocol, such as collagen embedding or 3D structuring. It also does not address the percentage of contaminating cells, subpopulation percentages in co-cultures, or differential cytotoxicity among subpopulations, which are key aspects of the question.","The assay uses human LUHMES cells differentiated into dopaminergic neurons as the test system. The differentiation process involves a series of steps: proliferating LUHMES cells are seeded in proliferation medium, then the medium is changed to differentiation medium containing tetracycline, GDNF, and dibutyryl-cAMP to induce neuronal differentiation. After 2 days of differentiation, cells are trypsinized and replated onto coated 96-well plates at a density of 30,000 cells per well. The differentiation process results in mature neurons with extended neurites, expressing dopaminergic markers such as tyrosine hydroxylase, and capable of electrical activity (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, sections 3.6 and 4.1).

The culture protocol involves coating plastic surfaces with poly-L-ornithine and fibronectin to promote cell attachment, followed by seeding and differentiation under specific conditions. No mention is made of embedding in collagen or forming 3D structures; the cells are maintained in a 2D monolayer format. The differentiation is achieved through exposure to specific growth factors and chemicals, notably tetracycline, GDNF, and dibutyryl-cAMP, which promote neuronal maturation and neurite outgrowth (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, sections 3.6 and 4.1).

Regarding contamination and subpopulations, the source LUHMES cells are characterized as a homogeneous dopaminergic neuronal population derived from human fetal ventral mesencephalon tissue. The protocol emphasizes that the cells should be pathogen-free, with regular testing for mycoplasma, and should not contain extensive aggregates or clustering. The cells are of human origin, express dopaminergic markers, and are not co-cultured with other cell types in this assay. Therefore, the presence of contaminating subpopulations is minimal and not specified as a concern in the protocol.

There is no indication that subpopulations within LUHMES cultures differ significantly in sensitivity to cytotoxicity, nor is there evidence that specific chemicals or classes of chemicals show differential cytotoxicity for subpopulations. The assay measures overall viability and neurite outgrowth, which could be influenced if certain subpopulations are more sensitive, but such differential sensitivities are not explicitly addressed in the protocol. The primary focus is on the dopaminergic neurons' response as a whole (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, sections 3.6, 4.7, and 4.8).",0.7687026716825442,0.14911408722400665,-0.07802016288042068,0.027844581753015518

The response is incomplete and lacks clarity.","The acceptance criteria for the NeuriTox assay's test system focus on ensuring cell quality and consistency at both the start and end of the experiment. Key endpoints and parameters include:

- **Cell morphology and confluency:** Cells should exhibit oval morphology, form neuronal networks with neurites approximately as long as their cell bodies, and reach a confluency of about 60%. Excessive aggregation or confluency above 90% should be avoided (Source: NeuriTox assay protocol).

- **Neurite outgrowth:** Prior to treatment, neurites should be at least as long as the cell bodies, with typical neurite length around 50 ±15 μm. If neurite length in negative controls falls below 25 μm, the experiment is discarded (Source: NeuriTox assay protocol).

- **Cell viability and health:** Cells should not be contaminated, medium should not be yellow/orange, and cell death should be around 5-10% in the working stock. Post-treatment, viability should remain ≥90% in negative controls (Source: NeuriTox assay protocol).

- **Differentiation status:** Differentiation should be sufficiently advanced, indicated by expression of neuronal markers and morphological features such as extensive neurite networks. The differentiation process is considered acceptable if the cells form networks with neurites comparable to those observed in previous successful runs.

- **Reproducibility and historical performance:** When the assay is performed repeatedly (e.g., 10 times), the typical neurite length in negative controls is around 50 μm with a standard deviation of approximately 15 μm. Variations beyond these ranges suggest issues with cell health or differentiation, prompting review or repetition.

**Actions if acceptance criteria are not met:**

- Discard the batch if morphological or neurite outgrowth parameters are below thresholds (e.g., neurite length <25 μm).
- Re-evaluate cell culture conditions, coating procedures, or passage number if morphology or confluency criteria are not met.
- Repeat the differentiation process if marker expression or morphological features are inconsistent.
- Ensure mycoplasma testing and contamination checks are performed regularly; discard contaminated cultures.
- If variability exceeds historical ranges, troubleshoot potential causes such as coating quality, cell passage number, or medium quality before proceeding.

However, it lacks specific details on critical consumables, handling steps, and controls with expected values and deviations. Recommendations for reproducibility are also not fully covered.","The known causes of variability for the final test system state include several critical factors:

- **Plate coating and plasticware:** Variability can arise from differences in PLO/fibronectin batches and water quality used for coating. Problems with coating can lead to uneven cell distribution, clumping, or aggregation. To mitigate this, plates and flasks should be washed twice after coating, washed with PBS instead of MilliQ water if issues occur, and used immediately without storage in the fridge.

- **Cell passage number and batch effects:** Cells from different vials or batches may behave differently. Cells tend to change morphology and behavior with increasing passage number; thus, using cells up to passage 18 is recommended. Thawing a new batch periodically helps maintain consistency.

- **Cell density and confluency:** Too high or too low cell density affects metabolism and differentiation. Confluency should be maintained between 40% and 90%, with approximately 60% at the start of the experiment. Deviations can cause variability in neurite outgrowth and viability.

- **Medium and supplement batches:** Variability in lots of medium, supplements, and growth factors (e.g., FGF, GDNF) can influence cell behavior. Consistent sourcing and batch testing are advised.

- **Handling steps:** Precise and rapid pipetting is critical, especially when adding test compounds. Tips should touch the well wall gently to avoid droplet formation and ensure even distribution. Operator training is essential; handling should be performed swiftly to minimize time at room temperature, which can affect cell health.

- **Test controls:** 
  - *Positive control:* Narciclasine (50 nM), expected to reduce neurite area to ≤75% of DMSO control and maintain viability ≥90%. Deviations beyond these ranges indicate variability.
  - *Negative control:* Solvent (0.1% DMSO), expected to show neurite area ≥35,000 and no significant change in viability.

- **Reproducibility recommendations:**
  - Use consistent plasticware and coating procedures.
  - Regularly verify cell confluency and morphology before experiments.
  - Limit passage number and thaw new batches periodically.
  - Standardize pipetting techniques, possibly with automated systems.
  - Include positive and negative controls in each run to monitor assay performance.
  - Document all handling steps meticulously.
  - Perform routine quality checks on media, supplements, and reagents.
  - Perform initial runs to establish baseline variability and set acceptable ranges for each parameter.

The assay involves staining the cells for 30 minutes at 37°C and 5% CO₂, followed by automated image acquisition using a high-content microscope (Array Scan VTI). 

Both endpoints—neurite area and cell viability—are measured simultaneously in the same wells under identical conditions. The nuclei are identified via Hoechst staining, and the neurite area is quantified based on calcein-AM staining. The quantification algorithm expands the nuclear outlines by 3.2 μm to define a virtual cell soma area (VCSA), which helps distinguish neurite pixels from cell bodies. The total calcein-positive pixels beyond the VCSA are calculated as the neurite area, while the calcein intensity within each VCSA indicates cell viability. Typically, about ten fields per well are imaged, capturing a representative sample of cells to ensure statistical robustness. This approach allows for the parallel assessment of neurite outgrowth and viability within the same well, providing a comprehensive picture of neurotoxicity effects.",0.7705788669906993,0.30321449041366577,0.17173628509044647,0.23726561665534973
"Provide information on machine settings, analytical standards, data processing and normalization procedures. For imaging endpoints: provide detailed algorithm. This information should also be covered in an SOP, preferably in DB-ALM format (see link in 6.6).","Quantification of neurite outgrowth An automated microplate reading microscope (Array-ScanII HCS Reader, Cellomics, PA) equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera (resolution 1024 x 1024; run at 2 x 2 binning) was used for image acquisition. Ten fields per well were imaged. Images were recorded in 2 channels using a 20x objective and excitation/emission wavelengths of 365 ± 50/535 ± 45 to detect H-33342 in channel 1 and 474 ± 40/535 ± 45 to detect calcein in channel 2. In both channels, a fixed exposure time and an intensity histogram-derived threshold were used for object identification. Neurite pixels were identified using the following image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified as objects in channel 1 according to their size, area, shape, and intensity which were predefined on untreated cells using a machine-based learning algorithm, and manual selection of nuclei to be classified as intact. The nuclear outlines were expanded by 3.2 µm in each direction, to define a virtual cell soma area (VCSA) based on the following procedure: The average width of the cytoplasm ring (distance nucleus - cell membrane) of LUHMES cells was experimentally determined to be 2.3 µm. Size irregularities were not always due to growing neurites, as determined by combined F-actin/tubulin beta-III staining. To avoid scoring of false positive neurite areas, the exclusion ring (VCSA) was made bigger than the average cell size. Then, we used two control compounds (U0126 and bisindolylmaleimid I) to vary the expanded outlines from 0.6 to 4 µm. We found 3.2 µm to be optimal both to detect neurite growth over time and to identify reduced neurite growth with high sensitivity. All calcein-positive pixels of the field (beyond a given intensity threshold) were defined as viable cellular structures (VCSs). The threshold was dynamically determined for each field after flat field and background correction and intensity normalization to 512 gray values and was set to 12% of the maximal brightness (channel 63 of 512). The VCS defines the sum of all somata and neurites without their assignment to individual cells. In an automatic calculation, the VCSAs, defined in the H- 33342 channel, were used as filter in the calcein channel and subtracted from the VCS. The remaining pixels (VCS - VCSA) in the calcein channel were defined as neurite area. Quantification of individual viable cells by imaging For a quantitative assessment of viable cells, the same images used to assess neurite area were analysed using another image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified in channel 1 as objects according to their size, area, shape, and intensity. Nuclei of apoptotic cells with increased fluorescence were excluded. A VCSA was defined around each nucleus by expanding it by 0.3 µm into each direction. Calcein-AM staining, labelling live cells, was detected in channel 2. The algorithm quantified the calcein intensity in the VCSA areas. Cells having an average calcein signal intensity in the VCSAs below a predefined threshold were classified by the program as “not viable”. Valid nuclei with a positive calcein signal in their cognate VCSA were counted as viable cells. A positive calcein signal was based on measurements of the average intensity (normal cells: 1300 ± 115, threshold: < 50) and the total integrated intensity (normal cells: 186,000 ± 23,600, threshold < 1000) of cells.",Medium,"The answer provides detailed information on the machine settings, imaging endpoints, and algorithms used for image analysis, which partially addresses the question. However, it lacks information on analytical standards, data processing, and normalization procedures beyond the imaging context. Additionally, there is no mention of an SOP or the DB-ALM format, which are specifically requested in the question.","The assay utilizes a Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS high content reader for imaging endpoints. The imaging process involves acquiring images in two channels: channel 1 (UV-Hoechst) for nuclei identification and channel 2 (Green-FITC) for calcein-AM staining of viable cells and neurite area measurement. Exposure times are set manually, and images are captured in 10 fields per well at 20x magnification with specific excitation/emission wavelengths (365 ± 50/535 ± 45 for Hoechst; 474 ± 40/535 ± 45 for calcein). 

For image analysis, the following detailed algorithm is employed:

- **Nuclei Identification:** Nuclei are identified as objects based on size, area, shape, and intensity in channel 1, using predefined parameters established with untreated controls and a machine learning algorithm.  
- **Virtual Cell Soma Area (VCSA):** The nuclear outlines are expanded by 3.2 µm in each direction to define a VCSA, which approximates the cell soma. This expansion was optimized through testing with control compounds (U0126 and bisindolylmaleimid I) to detect neurite growth sensitivity and reduce false positives.  
- **Neurite Pixel Detection:** All calcein-AM positive pixels beyond a dynamic intensity threshold (set at 12% of maximum brightness, determined per field after background correction) and outside the VCSA are classified as neurite pixels. The sum of these pixels constitutes the neurite area.  
- **Viable Cell Quantification:** Nuclei are re-identified in channel 1, excluding apoptotic nuclei with increased fluorescence. A VCSA of 0.3 µm around each nucleus is generated, and calcein-AM intensity within this area is measured. Cells with calcein intensity below a set threshold are classified as non-viable; those above are counted as viable cells.

Data processing involves exporting images and raw data into Excel files, where further analysis is performed using Excel, KNIME, GraphPad Prism, and BMCeasy software. Curve fitting for concentration-response data is conducted with nonlinear regression (least squares) using a 4-parameter log function, or linear regression if non-linear fitting is not feasible. The EC50 and BMC values are calculated from these fits, with BMCs and confidence intervals derived via BMCeasy.

**Relevance to test method:**  
These MCCs induce pathway-specific effects that either increase or decrease neurite outgrowth and viability, which are directly measured endpoints. Pathway activations (e.g., Rho activation by narciclasine) or inhibitions (e.g., ROCK inhibition by HA-1077) are known to correlate with the assay’s response, validating their use as mechanistic controls. They help set the acceptance criteria and ensure the assay’s responsiveness to pathway-specific perturbations.

It lacks clarity and completeness in addressing the question.","The negative controls used in the NeuriTox assay include solvent (0.1% DMSO), mannitol, paracetamol, and ASS (acetylsalicylic acid). The expected data on these controls should show neurite areas at least as long as the cell bodies (neurite area ≥ 35,000 pixels) and cell viability close to or above 90% of the DMSO control, with no significant reduction in neurite outgrowth or viability. The background noise, representing the assay's baseline variability, is characterized by the intra- and inter-experimental variation, with baseline variation in neurite outgrowth around 11.7% ± 4.5% and inter-experimental variation approximately 15.3% (Source: NeuriTox assay documentation).

The rationale for the concentration setting of negative controls is to use concentrations that do not induce toxicity or specific effects on neurite outgrowth, typically the solvent at 0.1% DMSO, which is known to be non-toxic at this level, and other compounds like mannitol and paracetamol at concentrations that do not impair cell health or neurite development. This ensures that the negative controls establish a baseline signal free of toxic or specific neurotoxic effects, allowing for accurate detection of compound-specific effects.

Yes, unspecific controls are used, including compounds such as mannitol, paracetamol, and ASS, which are selected because they are not expected to affect neurite outgrowth or cell viability at the concentrations used. Their purpose is to confirm that the assay's background signal remains stable and that any observed effects are due to specific toxicants rather than general cytotoxicity or assay artifacts. The concentrations for these controls are chosen based on prior knowledge of their non-toxic levels in neuronal cultures, typically at or below 0.1% DMSO equivalent, to avoid confounding effects (Source: NeuriTox assay protocol).",0.693355149377204,0.17267940938472748,-0.28345057368278503,-0.10210102051496506

The experimenter prepares a detailed plate map prior to the experiment, which is documented in the lab book and stored in Excel files on the work group server (Section 6.3). Pipetting is performed systematically, starting with the highest concentration wells and proceeding sequentially across the plate, typically from left to right, to minimize variability and ensure consistency (Section 6.3).

Adherence to the plate map during pipetting is documented by marking any pipetting errors directly on the plate map and recording them in the lab book immediately during the procedure (Section 6.3). This ensures traceability of any deviations from the planned layout.

Routine procedures for documenting intermediate steps, potential errors, mistakes, and uncertainties include manual recording in the lab book, noting pipetting errors, operator mistakes, and any issues encountered during handling (Section 6.3). Operators are trained to recognize and record such issues promptly, which helps in troubleshooting and data interpretation.

Errors such as pipetting twice in one well are documented by explicitly noting the mistake in the lab book and on the plate map. These wells are then either excluded from data analysis or flagged during data processing to prevent misinterpretation.

The serial dilutions are prepared in a separate deepwell plate, with the highest concentration solution being diluted stepwise to generate the lower concentrations. The serial dilution process ensures a consistent and reproducible concentration gradient across the test range (Source: NeuriTox assay description).

The starting dilutions are generally determined based on the solubility of the compound, the expected potency, and the need to cover concentrations that are relevant for observing effects without causing nonspecific toxicity. The protocol recommends diluting compounds in DMEM/F12 Advanced medium with 1% DMSO, with the highest concentration solution prepared to ensure solubility and stability, and then serially diluted to cover a wide range of concentrations (Source: NeuriTox assay description).

For functional endpoints that may not produce a full concentration-response curve, such as gene expression or neurite outgrowth, the test concentrations are often selected based on the effective concentration (EC) values derived from viability or other primary endpoints. For example, EC10 or EC25 values obtained from viability data are used to define test concentrations for gene expression endpoints, ensuring that the tested concentrations are within a biologically relevant and sub-cytotoxic range. This approach helps to identify specific effects at concentrations that do not induce overt cytotoxicity (Source: NeuriTox assay description).

The detailed SOP in the DB-ALM format specifies that the initial concentration range should be broad enough to capture potential effects, with serial dilutions performed systematically. When effects are observed at lower concentrations, subsequent testing may focus on those concentrations to refine the dose-response relationship.

For the concentration curve, a nonlinear regression fit is calculated. The fitting method is least squares. If a non-linear curve fit is not possible, a linear curve fit is performed. The curve deriving from the fit is a 4-parameter log function. To calculate the EC50 value, this log-function is solved for y=50% of the total scale, not for 50% of the min-max scale (see example below). Treated concentrations are analyzed for deviation from control. Sometimes it is analyzed whether the deviation of neurite growth is different from the deviation of viability. This is done by two-way ANOVA + Tukey-Kramer post hoc testing. Statistics applied are one-way ANOVA (and nonparametric) with Dunnett’s post test.

In cases of non-cytotoxicity or no observed effect, the highest tested concentration (HTC) is used as the point of reference, and no specific uncertainty is typically provided for these non-effect data. For non-monotonic curves or complex features that are difficult to fit with standard models, the usual approach is to visually inspect the data and, if necessary, adjust the fit parameters or use alternative models or manual interpretation to account for irregularities, as the standard curve-fitting procedures may not adequately describe such features (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf).",0.8584750332779326,0.21830959618091583,0.14493727684020996,0.18385134637355804

Several performance parameters for the test were obtained in several separate evaluation rounds. A first evaluation was done during the first publication of the model and its applications (Stiegler et al. 2011, Krueg et al. 2013). Here, a panel of well-selected positive and negative controls have been tested. Accordingly, the specificity was 100% and the sensitivity was > 90 %. In dedicated experiments, S/N ratios of > 20 and a z’ of > 0.5 have been determined. The compound narciclasine (run on each plate as positive control) was tested across 36 different test plates and 12 independent assay runs. The neurite area relative to the solvent control varied between 40% and 75% across all plates with a viability value constantly >90% (Delp et al. 2018). The test has been used in screening campaigns, and real-live performance data under broader screen conditions have been obtained. The different performance data need to be considered, when a compound is a hit in a screen, or whether it has been specifically evaluated in a hit follow-up or a mechanistic project. A first screen application has been the NTP80 screen (80 compounds provided by the US NTP). Data are published Delp et al. 2018. A second screen application has been the cross systems case study of the EU-ToxRisk project. The baseline variation is indicated in Krebs et al., 2020. Moreover, an overview is given for 19 compounds on the BMC/BMCL ratio as measure of readout certainty. A third screen was performed in the context of the EFSA DNT test battery evaluation with 120 compounds (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020).

The test has not been used extensively for IVIVE. However, data from the cell model (but different exposure scheme) have been used for IVIVE modelling (Loser et al., 2021, b). The test has also been used in projects with potency estimates and dose estimates (Klose et al., 2021; van der Stel et al., 2021). 3. No special considerations known.",Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing information on lipid and albumin content, which is relevant for determining free compound concentrations. It also mentions the use of the test for IVIVE and references some literature. However, it lacks details on protein content, cell volume, medium volume, surface area of the culture dish, and specific considerations for IVIVE such as compound accumulation or xenobiotic metabolism capacity.","The parameters important for determining free compound concentrations in the medium include the lipid content (2.9 mg/l) and albumin concentration (5.8 µM) in the in vitro medium (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf). The lipid content influences the partitioning of lipophilic compounds, while albumin binds many xenobiotics, affecting their free (unbound) concentrations. The cells express the dopamine transporter DAT and have a capacity for xenobiotic metabolism, which may influence compound accumulation and bioavailability (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf). 

The volume of the test system's cells is not explicitly specified, but the culture involves seeding 30,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate with a total medium volume of approximately 100 µl per well (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf). The medium volume per well is 100 µl, and the surface area of each well is about 0.32 cm² (standard 96-well plate). 

Regarding IVIVE strategies, the test has not been extensively used for IVIVE, but data from the cell model have been employed in IVIVE modeling, considering the medium's lipid and albumin content (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf). The medium's lipid and albumin levels are used to estimate free compound concentrations from nominal doses (see reference: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00204-020-02802-6). 

Special considerations for IVIVE include the potential for compound accumulation due to repeated medium changes and compound re-addition during the exposure period, which could lead to higher intracellular or extracellular concentrations than expected from initial dosing. The test system expresses MDR1 (P-glycoprotein), which can influence xenobiotic efflux, and has some capacity for xenobiotic metabolism, which may affect compound bioavailability and toxicity outcomes (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf).

It also mentions its implementation in a DNT battery and its preferential use in the first tier without complementary assays. However, it lacks a comprehensive discussion on potential weaknesses, restrictions, and gaps filled in a test battery, and does not fully explore the test's role in a broader test battery context.","Yes, the NeuriTox assay (UKN4) can be incorporated into a test battery for developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) assessment. It is specifically designed to evaluate impairments in neurite outgrowth in human dopaminergic neurons, reflecting a key neurodevelopmental process (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf). 

Strengths of the system in a test battery include its medium to high throughput, automation, and mechanistic relevance to neurodevelopmental key events such as neurite outgrowth. It is particularly useful as a first-tier screening tool to identify compounds that may cause specific neurodevelopmental hazards, especially those affecting CNS dopaminergic neurons. Its ability to detect specific effects on neuronal network formation makes it a good alerting and mechanistic follow-up assay (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf). 

Compared to similar tests, such as peripheral neuron neurite outgrowth assays (e.g., UKN5), the NeuriTox assay measures effects specifically in central nervous system dopaminergic neurons, which are relevant for disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Its performance shows high sensitivity (>90%) and good specificity (~82.7%) in screening campaigns, filling a gap in assays that target human CNS-specific neurodevelopmental processes (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf).

The assay fills a critical gap by providing a human-relevant, mechanistically interpretable key event for neurodevelopmental hazard identification, especially for compounds affecting dopaminergic neurons. It is suitable as a first-tier test due to its throughput and mechanistic basis, but it is recommended to be used in combination with other assays—such as general cytotoxicity tests, other neuronal subtype assays, or omics-based approaches—for comprehensive hazard assessment (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf).

In summary, the NeuriTox assay is best used as a stand-alone screening tool in early tiers for neurodevelopmental hazard detection, with subsequent mechanistic or confirmatory assays as needed. Its integration into a battery enhances the detection of specific neurotoxic effects and supports mechanistic understanding, addressing gaps in current testing strategies.",0.7959794807832403,0.15114741027355194,-0.015026943758130074,0.06579199433326721

The assay can be used to test KE activation, such as disruption of neurite outgrowth, which is a mechanistic key event in these AOPs. 

Specifically, the assay covers a fundamental neurodevelopmental process and can be integrated as a KE in AOPs related to neurotoxicity, including those in the AOP wiki.
