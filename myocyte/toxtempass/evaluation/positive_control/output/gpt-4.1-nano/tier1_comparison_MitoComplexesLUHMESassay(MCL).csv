It mentions critical consumables and handling steps, but lacks specific details on positive and negative controls, expected values, and accepted deviations. Recommendations for reproducibility are implied but not explicitly stated, leading to a partial and somewhat unclear response.","The known causes of variability for the final test system state include several critical factors:

Critical consumables or batch effects:
- Plate format and supplier: Different lots or manufacturers of plates and coating materials (e.g., poly-L-ornithine and fibronectin) can affect cell distribution and attachment.
- Batch effects of FCS or serum replacements: Variability in serum or serum replacements can influence cell growth and behavior.
- Additives and media components: Variations in medium supplements, such as FGF, can impact cell confluency and metabolic activity.

Critical handling steps and influencing factors:
- Coating procedures: Inconsistent coating with PLO and fibronectin can lead to uneven cell distribution and clumping.
- Cell density at seeding: Too high or too low cell density affects metabolism and differentiation; optimal confluency (around 80%) is essential.
- Pipetting technique: Precise, gentle pipetting is necessary to avoid cell damage or uneven seeding; rapid handling during medium changes and seeding is recommended.
- Timing of steps: Cells should be seeded and medium changes performed promptly to maintain consistent cell health and activity.
- Passage number: Cells should be used up to passage 18; higher passages may alter cellular behavior and increase variability.

Positive and negative controls:
- Negative control: Solvent (0.1% DMSO) with expected OCR similar to untreated cells; deviations should be within acceptable limits.
- Negative control: MG132 (100 nM) to confirm assay sensitivity.
- Inhibitors for mechanistic controls: Rotenone (cI), Malonate (cII), Antimycin A (cIII), Sodium azide (cIV), and FCCP (uncoupler) are used to validate complex activity measurements.
- Expected values: Negative controls should show stable OCR; inhibitors should significantly reduce activity of their target complexes, with deviations within a predefined acceptable range (e.g., ±10%).

Recommendations to increase/ensure reproducibility and performance:
- Use consistent, validated batches of consumables, especially plates and coating reagents.
- Standardize coating procedures and verify coating quality regularly.
- Maintain cells at consistent passage numbers and verify cell morphology and confluency before seeding.
- Train operators thoroughly in pipetting and handling techniques; perform handling steps swiftly and carefully.
- Regularly calibrate and maintain Seahorse XF analyzers.
- Include internal controls in each run to monitor assay performance.
- Document all procedures meticulously, including cell density, passage number, and reagent lot numbers.
- Perform routine quality checks on cell cultures (e.g., morphology, confluency, contamination).
- Use a sufficient number of technical replicates to account for variability.
- Establish and adhere to strict acceptance criteria for cell confluency, contamination, and OCR stability before and after compound exposure.

The overall cell culture scheme involves initial cell seeding, incubation, medium changes, and compound exposure, as follows:

1. **Cell Seeding and Preparation:**
   - LUHMES cells are trypsinized and re-seeded into coated Seahorse XF24-well plates at:
     - 60,000 cells per well for 1-day pre-incubation, or
     - 40,000 cells per well for 2-day pre-incubation.
   - Coating involves poly-L-ornithine and fibronectin, applied overnight, then washed and dried.
   - Cells are seeded in proliferation medium and allowed to attach:
     - 1 day prior to the assay (for 60,000 cells/well), or
     - 2 days prior (for 40,000 cells/well).

2. **Pre-Measurement Incubation:**
   - After seeding, cells are incubated for 1 or 2 days to allow attachment and growth.
   - Medium is not changed during this period; cells are maintained in proliferation medium.

3. **Medium Change and Preparation for OCR Measurement:**
   - On the day of measurement, the medium is replaced with MAS buffer, freshly supplemented with:
     - ADP (1 mM)
     - Digitonin (25 µg/ml) for permeabilization
   - This step occurs immediately before the measurement.

4. **Measurement Timeline:**
   - The Seahorse XF Analyzer is calibrated and rehydrated with XF Calibrant at 37°C without CO₂, typically 1 hour before measurement.
   - The assay involves:
     - Baseline OCR measurement (before compound addition).
     - Sequential injections of substrates and inhibitors to assess activity of mitochondrial complexes:
       - Tier 1: pyruvate, glutamine, malate (for complex I), then rotenone (complex I inhibitor), malonate (complex II inhibitor), duroquinol (complex III substrate).
       - Tier 2: succinate (complex II substrate), TMPD + ascorbic acid (complex IV substrates), with inhibitors as needed.
   - The compounds of interest are added just before the measurement begins, with the final compound concentration prepared in MAS buffer.

5. **Compound Addition and Re-Addition:**
   - Test compounds are added directly into MAS buffer immediately before measurement.
   - During the assay, if medium changes are necessary (e.g., for longer exposure or different conditions), compounds are re-added in the fresh medium, maintaining the same final concentration.
   - No medium change occurs during the actual measurement unless specified; the assay is designed for short-term exposure.

6. **Critical Medium Supplements:**
   - ADP and digitonin are added freshly before measurement.
   - The MAS buffer contains mannitol, sucrose, KH₂PO₄, MgCl₂, HEPES, EGTA, and BSA, sterile filtered and stored at 4°C.
   - Final DMSO concentration in compound solutions is kept at 0.1%.

The measurement of mitochondrial complex activity is performed in the same wells, under identical experimental conditions, allowing direct comparison of the effects of test compounds on each complex within the same cell population. The assay does not involve fixation or homogenization; instead, it relies on live-cell OCR measurements. Quantification involves analyzing the OCR data to calculate the activity of each complex as a percentage relative to controls, based on the OCR changes after addition of specific substrates and inhibitors.

The signal should be stable and close to the initial OCR levels, with minimal variability, which reflects the background noise of the test method.

The rationale for the concentration setting of the negative control (0.1% DMSO) is to match the solvent used for dissolving test compounds, ensuring that any observed effects are due to the test substances and not the solvent itself. The concentration of DMSO is kept low to avoid solvent-induced toxicity or mitochondrial impairment, maintaining the assay’s baseline conditions (Source: EFSA Case Study on Tebufenpyrad, Part 2 – Annex A).

Yes, unspecific controls are used; specifically, the solvent (DMSO) at 0.1% is employed as a negative control to account for any effects of the solvent.

- Over a 5-day workweek, this amounts to 60 data points (12 per day × 5 days).  
- Assuming 3 working weeks per month, the total is approximately 180 data points (60 per week × 3 weeks).  
- The document states a total of 192 data points per month, which accounts for minor variations or additional runs.  

Controls necessary for calibration and acceptability are not counted as data points.  
Regarding repeated measures over time from the same dish, the protocol involves seeding cells 1 or 2 days prior to measurement, with measurements typically performed on the day of the assay. Since the assay is designed for a single measurement per well, repeated measures from the same dish over time are generally not performed within this protocol. Instead, multiple independent dishes are used for replicates.  

**Estimate of repeated measures:**  
- The assay does not include repeated measurements over time from the same dish; each measurement is a snapshot at a specific time point.  
- If repeated measures are desired, they would require additional dishes or wells prepared at different time points, but this is not part of the standard protocol.  

**Extent of repeated measures:**  
- Not applicable under the standard protocol; each dish provides a single data point per condition.  
- Any repeated measures would be experimental extensions and are not included in the typical throughput estimate.

For the concentration curve, a nonlinear regression fit is calculated. The fitting method is least squares. If a non-linear curve fit is not possible, a linear curve fit is performed. The curve deriving from the fit is a 4-parameter log function. Treated concentrations are analyzed for deviation from control. Sometimes it is analyzed whether the deviation of neurite growth is different from the deviation of viability. This is done by two-way ANOVA + Tukey-Kramer post hoc testing. Statistics applied are one-way ANOVA (and nonparametric) with Dunnett’s post test.

However, it lacks clarity on how non-monotonic curves are handled and does not explicitly address uncertainty measures for non-cytotoxicity or no-effect. The mention of BMC values and confidence intervals is relevant but not fully detailed.","The assay data are processed by normalizing all OCR values to the last measurement before compound injection. The normalized OCR values are then used to calculate the activity of each mitochondrial complex as a percentage of the control (Source: EFSA Case Study on MCL). Concentration-response curves are modeled using nonlinear regression fitting, typically with a 4-parameter log function, to derive parameters such as the BMC (Benchmark Concentration). If nonlinear fitting is not feasible, a linear fit may be performed (Source: EFSA Case Study on MCL). The software used for curve fitting and data analysis includes GraphPad Prism and Excel, with BMC values and their confidence intervals (e.g., BMCL) calculated via the online tool http://invitrotox.uni-konstanz.de/BMCeasy/ (Source: EFSA Case Study on MCL). 

Uncertainty measures, such as 95% confidence intervals for BMC or BMCL, are routinely calculated using this software. For non-cytotoxic or no-effect data, the assay considers the activity unchanged if it does not deviate more than 2xSD of baseline variation, but explicit uncertainty for these cases is not always provided. 

Handling non-monotonic curve shapes or complex features that are difficult to fit with standard models involves visual inspection and, if necessary, alternative approaches such as linear fits or qualitative interpretation. When the curve shape is non-monotonic or irregular, the usual mathematical fit may be adjusted or complemented by expert judgment, but the primary approach remains the use of nonlinear regression with the specified software (Source: EFSA Case Study on MCL).",0.7698564638451759,0.3095228672027588,0.12649501860141754,0.2147015929222107

This AOP involves the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I as a key event (KE) leading to adverse outcomes such as neurodegeneration and motor deficits (Source: AOPwiki). 

The assay directly measures the activity of mitochondrial complexes (cI, cII, cIII, cIV), thus it can serve as a test of KE activation related to mitochondrial complex inhibition, which is a key event in this AOP. It can cover an AOP MIE/KE by assessing impairment in mitochondrial complex activity, which is central to the pathway described in AOP 3 (Source: EFSA Journal 2023:7794).
