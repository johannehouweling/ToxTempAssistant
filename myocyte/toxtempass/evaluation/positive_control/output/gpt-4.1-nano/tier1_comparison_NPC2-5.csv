Please describe in no more than 200 words the following:,"The human developing central nervous system may be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of chemical agents than the adult brain. At present, due to the knowledge gap concerning hazard identification for human neurodevelopmental toxicity (DNT), there is an urgent need for testing and subsequent regulation of chemicals for their potential to interfere with the developing nervous system. Primary human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) cultivated as three-dimensional floating spheres are able to represent several key processes during brain development. In the neural progenitor cell migration and differentiation assay (NPC2-5), hNPCs are plated on an extracellular matrix, and migrate and differentiate out of the sphere core. Thereby the processes radial glia migration, migration of neurons and oligodendrocytes as well as differentiation into neurons and oligodendrocytes and neurite outgrowth can be studied. Those DNT-specific endpoints are studied in combination with general cell viability and cytotoxicity. Cell migration and differentiation are critical processes during brain development that, if disturbed, lead to alterations in brain development and may cause cognitive dysfunction. Currently, cortical NPC migration- and differentiation-related processes are some of the many processes, which are assessed in the OECD TG426 by neuropathological evaluation of certain brain regions as well as neurobehavioral tests. According to the readiness criteria as published by Bal-Price et al. (2018), the neural progenitor cell migration and differentiation assay obtained readiness scores between A and B depending on the endpoint.",Medium,"The answer provides a detailed description of the vulnerability of the developing central nervous system to chemical agents and the need for testing.

The use of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is critical for sphere growth. FGF contains 1% bovine serum albumin and is thus prone to batch effects. Critical handling The thawing medium contains DMSO in a concentration that affects cell health which is why thawed cells should quickly be diluted in proliferation medium (30 mL of media for one vial of cells). It is recommended to add FGF into the proliferation medium directly before thawing.

   - Neurospheres reach a size of 0.2–0.5 mm after 3–4 weeks of expansion, with mechanical passaging every 7 days to maintain size and self-renewal.

2. **Plating and Initiation of Differentiation:**
   - Neurospheres are mechanically dissociated into smaller pieces (~0.15–0.25 mm) and plated onto poly-D-lysine/laminin-coated 96-well plates.
   - Each sphere is placed in the middle of a well in differentiation medium (DMEM/Ham’s F12 with 1% N2 supplement, penicillin, and streptomycin) to promote migration and differentiation.

3. **Differentiation and Migration Phase:**
   - Cells are cultured at 37°C, 5% CO₂, with medium changes every 2–3 days.
   - The differentiation period lasts up to 5 days, during which radial glia, neurons, and oligodendrocytes migrate out from the sphere core.
   - Medium is supplemented with specific factors depending on the endpoint (e.g., growth factors or inhibitors) to modulate differentiation pathways.

4. **Manipulation Steps:**
   - Medium changes involve replacing half of the medium on day 3 to sustain differentiation conditions.
   - Mechanical passaging of neurospheres occurs weekly during expansion.
   - For the assay, spheres are plated at a size of 0.3 mm, and the process involves careful handling to prevent aggregation and ensure uniform size.

**Substrates and Interaction:**
- The substrate is a poly-D-lysine/laminin coating, which supports cell adhesion, migration, and interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM)-like environment.
- The self-organization of neurospheres and their interaction with the matrix are critical, mimicking in vivo tissue architecture.

**Special Requirements for Microphysiological Systems:**
- The assay involves self-aggregation and self-organization of neurospheres, which produce ECM components and paracrine cues guiding migration and differentiation.
- Precise control of sphere size and shape is essential for reproducibility.
- The assay setup may include cell printing or microfabrication techniques to generate uniform spheres or organoid-like structures, although this is not explicitly detailed in the protocol.
- Geometrical characterization (size, shape, and migration pattern) is performed via automated imaging and image analysis software, ensuring consistent assessment of migration distances and morphological features.

In summary, the differentiation protocol is a multi-phase process involving initial expansion, mechanical dissociation, plating on ECM-coated substrates, and culture in differentiation medium with medium changes and manipulations to promote migration and differentiation. The self-organization and interaction with the matrix are fundamental, especially for modeling complex neurodevelopmental processes in a microphysiological context.",0.7947601230125899,0.18446674942970276,0.056500427424907684,0.1206129863858223

However, it lacks information on the percentage of contaminating cells, the percentage of each subpopulation in co-cultures, and whether specific chemicals show differential cytotoxicity for the cell sub-populations used. These omissions prevent a 'High' score.","The test system used in the NPC2-5 assay is based on primary human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) derived from the human fetal cortex (gestational weeks 16-19). These cells are cultivated as self-organized three-dimensional neurospheres, which reflect several key neurodevelopmental processes such as migration of radial glia, neurons, and oligodendrocytes, as well as differentiation into neurons and oligodendrocytes, and neurite outgrowth (Source: NPC2-5.pdf).

The generation of the test system involves several complex steps. Initially, source hNPCs are expanded in proliferation medium containing growth factors (EGF and FGF) and are characterized for specific markers (nestin, SOX2, Ki67). For differentiation, neurospheres are mechanically dissociated into uniform-sized spheres (0.2–0.5 mm) and plated onto poly-D-lysine/laminin coated plates in differentiation medium (DMEM/Ham’s F12 with N2 supplement and penicillin-streptomycin). The spheres are then cultured for up to four weeks, with passaging every week to maintain the self-organized 3D structure (Source: NPC2-5.pdf).

The culture protocol involves several key features:
- The neurospheres are cultivated in a 3D self-organized format, mimicking in vivo tissue architecture.
- During differentiation, the medium is supplemented with specific growth factors and signaling molecules to promote migration and differentiation into various neural subpopulations.
- The assay plates are coated with extracellular matrix components (poly-D-lysine/laminin) to support cell attachment and migration.
- The process does not involve embedding in collagen or other matrices, but relies on the self-organizing capacity of the neurospheres on coated surfaces.
- The protocol includes controlled mechanical passaging to maintain uniform sphere size and prevent aggregation.
- The assay measures multiple endpoints related to migration, differentiation, and morphology, with immunocytochemistry used to identify specific cell types (e.g., nestin for radial glia, β-III-tubulin for neurons, O4 for oligodendrocytes).

Regarding cell populations, the source neurospheres contain a mixture of cell types:
- Radial glia cells (nestin-positive, GFAP-positive)
- Neurons (β-III-tubulin-positive), typically 1.5–16%
- Oligodendrocytes (O4-positive), typically 1.5–11%
- Astrocytes (GFAP-positive)

The exact percentage of contaminating or subpopulations can vary depending on donor and culture conditions, but the assay is designed to reflect the natural heterogeneity of fetal brain tissue. In co-cultures, the proportions of each subpopulation are generally stable within the specified ranges, and the assay's endpoints are sensitive to effects on these subpopulations.

It is known that certain subpopulations may differ in sensitivity to cytotoxicity. For example, radial glia and astrocytes, which are more abundant, may be more resistant or more sensitive depending on the chemical class. This differential sensitivity can influence viability measures, especially since the assay assesses viability based on mitochondrial activity (resazurin reduction) and membrane integrity (LDH release) across all cell types within the migration area. If a chemical preferentially affects one subpopulation, it could lead to an apparent change in overall viability, potentially biasing the interpretation.

Specific chemicals or classes of chemicals may indeed show differential cytotoxicity for subpopulations, but this is not fully characterized within the assay. The assay's design allows for the detection of such differential effects indirectly through endpoints like cell type-specific marker expression and migration patterns, but detailed mechanistic data on subpopulation-specific sensitivity are limited.",0.7830884459958004,0.1462094485759735,-0.055297158658504486,0.04026385396718979

The response is partially complete but lacks clarity and detail in some areas.","The acceptance criteria for the test system, specifically the human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), focus on several key endpoints and parameters to ensure cell quality and consistency. The primary endpoints include the morphology and size of the neurospheres, the expression of specific markers, and contamination status.

**Endpoints and Parameters:**
- **Sphere size:** At the start of differentiation, neurospheres should be rounded and have a size of 0.25–0.35 mm. This ensures uniformity in the starting material.
- **Marker expression:** Differentiated cells should express characteristic markers such as nestin, β-III-tubulin (neurons), GFAP (astrocytes), and O4 (oligodendrocytes). The expression levels confirm proper differentiation.
- **Contamination status:** Cells must be free of mycoplasma, bacteria, and fungi, as confirmed by regular testing.
- **Cell viability:** A minimum viability of at least 20% is required upon receipt and during expansion.

**Parameters Important for Cell Quality:**
- Sphere morphology and size
- Marker expression levels
- Absence of contamination
- Cell viability

**Historical Performance and Variation:**
- When differentiation is performed across multiple runs (e.g., 10 times), the typical sphere size at start is consistently within 0.25–0.35 mm with a coefficient of variation (CV) around 10–15%. Marker expression levels such as nestin induction are usually around 200 ±40 fold, with experiments showing inductions below 80-fold being discarded.
- Usual neurite length in differentiated neurons is approximately 50 ±15 μm; experiments with average neurite length below 25 μm in negative controls are discarded.
- The differentiation into specific cell types (neurons, oligodendrocytes) generally shows marker expression percentages above 1.5%, with lower values indicating suboptimal differentiation and leading to discarding of such experiments.

**Actions if Acceptance Criteria Are Not Met:**
- If sphere size deviates significantly from the 0.25–0.35 mm range, the batch is rejected or the protocol is adjusted.
- If marker expression levels are below the established thresholds (e.g., nestin induction below 80-fold in controls), the experiment is discarded.
- If contamination is detected, the cell batch is discarded, and new cells are sourced.
- If neurite length or other morphological parameters fall outside the typical range, the experiment is not considered valid and is repeated.

The variability for the different endpoints is shown in 8.4 “Test Performance”.",Low,"The answer does not adequately address the question. It mentions sources of variation related to sphere selection and biological variability but fails to provide details on critical consumables, batch effects, handling steps, controls, expected values, or recommendations for reproducibility and performance.","The known causes of variability for the final test system state include biological heterogeneity of the source cells, differences in sphere size at day 0, and variability in differentiation capacity among donors (Source: NPC2-5.pdf). Critical consumables or batch effects involve the use of source cells from Lonza, with variability potentially arising from donor differences, and batch effects of FGF, which contains bovine serum albumin and is prone to batch effects. Plate format and coating materials (poly-D-lysine/laminin) are critical, as they influence cell migration and differentiation, and should be consistent. Batch effects of fetal calf serum (FCS) or serum replacements are not explicitly mentioned but are generally critical in cell culture; thus, batch consistency is recommended.

Critical handling steps include careful pipetting, especially during medium changes and cell dissociation, to prevent uneven cell distribution or damage. The transfer of spheres should be performed gently, and the plates should be handled to minimize vibrations and vibrations that can lead to aggregation. During plating, the cell density must be controlled to ensure uniform migration and differentiation; spheres should be well distributed to prevent aggregation.

Positive controls used are PP2 (SRC kinase inhibitor) for radial glia migration, EGF for neuronal differentiation, and BMP7 for oligodendrocyte differentiation, with expected effects: PP2 reduces migration, EGF reduces neuronal differentiation, and BMP7 reduces oligodendrocyte differentiation. Negative controls include solvent controls (DMSO, DPBS, ddH2O, MeOH) with expected responses within the defined ranges for each endpoint.

Acceptance criteria for controls are: radial glia migration (700–1500 µm at 72h, 700–1600 µm at 120h), cell number (2500–6000), and differentiation percentages (≥1.5%). Deviations outside these ranges indicate variability or technical issues.

To increase reproducibility and performance, it is recommended to:
- Use consistent source cell batches and verify their characterization before use.
- Maintain strict control over coating procedures and plate formats.
- Automate pipetting steps where possible to reduce user variability.
- Ensure consistent sphere size at plating (0.25–0.35 mm) and uniform distribution.
- Regularly verify control responses and document deviations.
- Perform training for operators on handling and pipetting techniques.
- Use batch controls for critical reagents like FGF and FCS.
- Handle plates gently, avoid vibrations, and minimize time delays during medium changes and transfers.
- Include multiple technical replicates and controls in each run to monitor variability.

Give information on where the test system differs from the mimicked human tissue and which gaps of analogy need to be considered.,"hNPCs reflect the following in vivo tissue features: In differentiation culture: NPC2a – radial glia cell migration → corresponding to radial glia cell migration during corticogenesis in vivo. The migrated hNPCs exhibit the characteristic elongated radial glia (RG)-like morphology and express the RG-markers nestin and GFAP as well as the proliferation marker Ki-67 (Koch et al., 2022). In accordance with in vivo studies, exposure to EGF (0.5-1 ng/mL) after neurosphere plating enhances hNPC migration compared to the solvent control (Koch et al., 2022). As a second human-relevant key regulator of migration, hNPCs respond to SRC-family kinase inhibition (PP2) with reduced migration (Moors et al., 2007; Koch et al., 2022). The migration speed of hNPCs in vitro is in the same range as migrating mouse granule cells in vivo (Baumann et al., 2016, Fahrion et al., 2012). NPC2b – migration of young cortical neurons on radial glia scaffolds → corresponding to cortical neuronal radial migration. NPC2c – oligodendrocyte migration → corresponding to oligodendrocyte migration during corticogenesis. NPC3 – fetal neuronal differentiation into young neurons → corresponding to cortical neurogenesis in vivo. Over the time course of differentiation, neurons expressing β-III-tubulin progressively appear in the migration zone representing approximately 20% of the mixed culture after 5 days. In line with observations in vivo, inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway during hNPC differentiation increases neuronal numbers compared to the solvent control (Koch et al., 2022). Moreover, narciclasine, an activator of Ras homolog family member A (RhoA), reduces neuronal differentiation of hNPCs cultured for 5 days in a concentration-dependent manner (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020; Blum et al., 2023). Likewise, RhoA inactivation stimulated axon regeneration and recovery of hindlimb function after spinal cord injury in mice (Dergham et al., 2002). NPC4 – neurite length, neurite area of young primary fetal neurons → corresponding to axon/dendrite formation in vivo. During the 5 days of hNPC differentiation, neurite maturation is characterized by an elongation of neurites and an increase in neurite area (Koch et al., 2022). Increase in RhoA activity caused morphological alterations in rat cortical neurons in vivo (Chen et al., 2018). In line with that, RhoA activator narciclasine reduced both neurite area and neurite length (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020). NPC5 – oligodendrocyte formation from fetal hNPCs → corresponding to oligodendrogenesis during the fetal phase of brain development. Differentiation of hNPCs over 5 days progressively generates cells expressing the oligodendrocyte-marker O4, which exhibit the typical oligodendrocyte morphology with multiple branched processes necessary to ensheath neuronal axons (Moors et al., 2009; Koch et al., 2022). Differentiation of hNPCs in the presence of the Notch inhibitor DAPT concentration-dependently decreases the percentage of O4-positive cells compared to the solvent control (Koch et al., 2022). Moreover, oligodendrocyte differentiation is negatively influenced by bone morphogenic protein (BMP) 7 (Baumann et al., 2015) and BMP2 (Masjosthusmann et al., 2018), proteins of the transforming growth factor β family. These data demonstrate that two major developmental pathways, i.e. Notch and BMP, are functional in hNPCs. Primary hNPCs are self-organized and produce auto- and paracrine cues like heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) and neuregulins that guide migration and differentiation. Moreover, they express extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins like laminin subunits, fibronectin and collagens (microarray data from Klose et al. 2021). Hence, effects concerning ECM-like adhesion defects can be assessed with this assay (Barenys et al. 2017).

Cytotoxicity is assessed as a secondary endpoint, measured via LDH release, and is used to distinguish specific neurodevelopmental effects from general cytotoxic effects. It is not the primary endpoint; instead, the primary endpoints focus on cell migration, differentiation, and morphological features relevant to neurodevelopment. 

Potential reference/normalization endpoints include cell number (all cells in the migration area), which is used for normalization of neuronal and oligodendrocyte differentiation data, as well as cytotoxicity measures (LDH release) and viability (resazurin reduction).

For imaging endpoints: Explain in general how quantification algorithm or how semi-quantitative estimates are obtained and how many cells are imaged (roughly).","Primary endpoints: 1 . Radial glia migration 72 h is assessed as migration distance in µm from the edge of the sphere core to the edge of the migration area based on brightfield images of each well (Figure 3). Therefore, each plate is scanned after 72 h in culture in an automated high content imaging device under 5% CO2 and 37°C. Images are exported and the sphere size in four directions is measured manually using ImageJ. All other primary endpoints are assessed based on an ICC staining image for each sphere. Therefore, cells are fixated after 120 h in culture and an ICC staining with Hoechst for nuclei, β-III-tubulin for neurons and O4 for oligodendrocytes is performed. The plates are scanned using an automated high content imaging device and all nuclei and their positions are determined automatically based on their intensity and size. Images are imported to the Omnisphero software (https://omnisphero.com) to run the image analysis that measures the following endpoints. 2 . Radial glia migration 120h is assessed as the migration distance in µm between the sphere core and the edge of the migration area based on ICC images of Hoechst-positive nuclei. By identification of each nuclei’s position in relation to the sphere core, the migration distance can be calculated. Therefore, a density distribution mask is calculated. By scanning the images of the nuclei channel, the algorithm can determine relatively more or less dense image areas. By identifying the densest area in the image, the sphere core can be detected. For identification of the migration, it is assumed, that the nuclei density decreases with increasing distance to the sphere core. Once the density hits a pre-defined threshold, the outer boundaries are determined and the sphere itself can be mapped out in a polynomial bounding box. Derived from this box, the actual size and migration distance can be calculated for each well. 3 . Neuronal migration 120 h is the mean distance of all neurons from the edge of the sphere core in relation to the radial glia migration and is determined based on the position of each neuron (see neuronal differentiation). 4 . Oligodendrocyte migration 120 h is the mean distance of all oligodendrocytes from the edge of the sphere core in relation to the radial glia migration and is determined based on the position of each oligodendrocytes (see oligodendrocyte differentiation). 5 . Neuronal differentiation is defined as the number of all β-III-tubulin-positive cells in percent of the cell number (Hoechst-positive cells) in the migration area after 120 h of differentiation. The identification of neurons is done automatically using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Training of the CNN was done based on manually annotated experiments (Förster et al., 2021). 6 . Neurite length 120 h is the mean length in µm of all neurons (see neuronal differentiation) that are identified by the skeletonization algorithm in Omnisphero (https://omnisphero.com). 7 . Neurite area 120 h is the mean area in pixels (without nuclei) of all neurons (see neuronal differentiation) that are identified by the skeletonization algorithm in Omnisphero (https://omnisphero.com). 8 . Oligodendrocyte differentiation 120 h is defined as the number of all O4-positive cells in percent of the cell number (Hoechst-positive cells) within the migration area after 120 h of differentiation. The identification of oligodendrocytes is done automatically using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Training of the CNN was done based on manually annotated experiments (Förster et al., 2021). Secondary endpoints: 3 . Cell number is the number of all Hoechst-positive nuclei detected within the area between the sphere core and the outer boundaries of the migration area (see radial glia migration 120 h). 4 . Cytotoxicity 72/120 h is assessed as membrane integrity by measuring the amount of LDH leaked from cells with damaged plasma membranes. LDH-dependent reduction of resazurin to resorufin is measured in the supernatant of each well as fluorescence of the reaction product resorufin (relative fluorescence unit) in a multiplate reader after 72/120 h of differentiation and compound treatment. 5 . Viability 120 h is assessed as mitochondrial activity by measuring the amount of resazurin reduced to fluorescent resorufin (relative fluorescence unit) in a multiplate reader in the last two hours of the 120 h differentiation and compound treatment period.",High,"The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the analytical methods used, detailing the key steps and principles involved in assessing various endpoints.

The explanation includes how different endpoints are measured, the use of automated imaging devices, and the software employed for analysis. The response is relevant, complete, and sufficient for reviewers to understand the methods without needing full procedural details.","The NPC2-5 assay employs a combination of high-content imaging and automated image analysis to assess multiple neurodevelopmental endpoints in human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs). Cells are cultured as three-dimensional neurospheres, which are plated on coated 96-well plates and subjected to immunocytochemical staining for specific markers. 

For imaging endpoints, the assay involves fixing the cells after 120 hours of differentiation, followed by immunocytochemistry using antibodies against nuclei (Hoechst), neurons (β-III-tubulin), and oligodendrocytes (O4). Brightfield images are used to measure migration distances, while fluorescence images are acquired for cell identification and quantification. The migration distance of radial glia, neurons, and oligodendrocytes is calculated based on the spatial distribution of Hoechst-positive nuclei and cell-specific markers relative to the sphere core. The number of neurons and oligodendrocytes is automatically determined by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on manually annotated images, providing percentage differentiation metrics. Neurite length and area are quantified using skeletonization algorithms within the Omnisphero software, which analyze the morphology of β-III-tubulin-positive neurons.

All endpoints—migration, differentiation, neurite outgrowth, cell number, viability, and cytotoxicity—are measured from the same fixed and stained cultures within each well, allowing parallel assessment under identical conditions. For migration measurements, brightfield images are acquired after 72 hours, while immunocytochemical images are taken after 120 hours. Cytotoxicity (LDH release) and viability (resazurin reduction) are assessed in supernatants or live cell assays, respectively, at corresponding time points, often in separate but related assays.

Quantification algorithms involve automated image analysis: nuclei are identified based on Hoechst staining, and their positions are used to calculate migration distances; CNNs automatically classify cells as neurons or oligodendrocytes; skeletonization algorithms measure neurite length and area. Typically, thousands of cells per well are imaged to ensure statistical robustness, with the exact number depending on the endpoint and image resolution.",0.7582527377552927,0.033696889877319336,0.11208513379096985,0.0752645954489708

Endpoint-specific control effects on NPC2a, NPC3 and NPC5 from n>40 experiments are shown in figure 4. The locations of the endpoint-specific controls on the experimental plate are shown in figure 5. 3. Radial glia migration 72 h: The endpoint-specific control for radial glia migration after 72 h is the SRC kinase inhibitor PP2. SRC family kinases represent one pathway that regulates radial glia migration of differentiating hNPCs (Moors et al., 2007). Inhibition of this pathway with PP2 (10 µM) causes a reduction of radial glia cell migration to values between 0 and 60 % of the solvent control. 4. Neuronal differentiation: The endpoint specific control for neuronal differentiation is EGF. EGF is a growth factor that stimulates radial glia proliferation and migration and inhibits neuronal differentiation (Ayuso-Sacido et al., 2010; Jenny Baumann et al., 2016). 20 ng/mL EGF reduces neuronal differentiation to values between 0 and 50% of the solvent control. 5. Oligodendrocyte differentiation: The endpoint specific control for oligodendrocyte differentiation is BMP7. BMP7 promotes the BMP signaling cascade which upregulates astroglia differentiation and maturation and inhibits oligodendrocyte formation (Jenny Baumann et al., 2016; Gross et al., 1996; Mabie et al., 1997). 100 ng/mL BMP7 reduces oligodendrocyte differentiation to values between 0 and 60 % of the SC. Figure 4: Effects of endpoint-specific positive controls. The SRC kinase inhibitor PP2 reduces radial glia migration (NPC2a), epidermal growth factor (EGF) reduces neuronal differentiation (NPC3) and bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP7) reduces oligodendrocyte differentiation (NPC5).

It also does not address the quality of in vivo reference data or whether in vivo relevant threshold concentrations are known.","The positive controls used in the NPC2-5 assay are specific compounds known to affect the targeted neurodevelopmental processes. These include:

- PP2, a SRC kinase inhibitor, used as a control for radial glia migration (NPC2a). It reduces migration to 0–60% of the solvent control (Source: Assay description).
- EGF, a growth factor, used as a control for neuronal differentiation (NPC3). It reduces neuronal differentiation to 0–50% of the solvent control (Source: Assay description).
- BMP7, a bone morphogenic protein, used as a control for oligodendrocyte differentiation (NPC5). It reduces oligodendrocyte differentiation to 0–60% of the solvent control (Source: Assay description).

The expected data on these controls show a significant reduction in the respective endpoints, with the response typically falling within the range of 0–60% of the solvent control, depending on the endpoint and concentration. The responses are measured with associated uncertainty, which is reflected in the confidence intervals (CIs) of the BMCs; these CI bounds provide an estimate of the variability and uncertainty in the effect size (Source: Assay description).

Regarding in vivo reference data, the assay documentation indicates that the effects of these controls are well-characterized in the literature, but specific quantitative in vivo reference concentrations are not explicitly provided. The data from positive controls are used to validate the assay's responsiveness and mechanistic relevance, but the assay does not specify exact threshold concentrations in vivo. Instead, it relies on the known biological effects of these compounds to interpret the in vitro responses, and the relevance of the concentrations used is considered in the context of their known in vivo activity and exposure levels (Source: Assay description).",0.6355051071001111,-0.06622782349586487,-0.1303175985813141,-0.09489919990301132

However, it lacks details on the expected data (signal and its uncertainty) for these controls, the rationale for concentration settings, and whether unspecific controls are used. The answer is partially complete but lacks clarity and detail in some areas.","The negative controls used in the NPC2-5 assay include the solvent control (SC), which is typically DMSO at 0.1% v/v, as well as other established negative controls such as DPBS, ddH2O, and MeOH at specified concentrations (Source: NPC2-5.pdf). These controls are expected to produce signal responses within the acceptable range defined by the assay's acceptance criteria, representing the baseline or background noise level of the test system. The data from these controls should show minimal effect on the endpoints, with variability characterized by the coefficient of variation (CV), which is generally low (e.g., intra-experimental CV around 5-10% for migration endpoints, and slightly higher for differentiation endpoints). The uncertainty associated with these signals reflects the inherent biological and technical variability, serving as the baseline against which test compound effects are compared (Source: NPC2-5.pdf).

The rationale for the concentration setting of negative controls is to match the solvent or vehicle used for test compounds, ensuring that any observed effects are attributable to the test substances rather than the solvent itself. The solvent concentrations are kept at levels known not to interfere with cell viability, migration, or differentiation processes, typically at the highest concentration used in the test (e.g., 0.1% DMSO). This approach ensures that the background noise level is accurately characterized under conditions that do not induce toxicity or biological effects (Source: NPC2-5.pdf).

Yes, the assay employs unspecific negative controls, such as compounds known not to affect neurodevelopmental endpoints. Examples include acetaminophen, amoxicillin, aspirin, buspirone, chlorpheniramine maleate, D-Glucitol, diethylene glycol, D-mannitol, doxylamine succinate, famotidine, ibuprofen, metformin, metoprolol, penicillin VK, saccharin, sodium benzoate, and warfarin. These compounds are selected because they are not associated with neurodevelopmental toxicity in vivo and are expected to produce signals within the background noise range of the assay. The concentration of these negative controls is typically set at levels that are solubility-compatible and do not induce cytotoxicity or other non-specific effects, often based on known safe exposure levels or solubility limits, to serve as a baseline for non-toxic effects (Source: NPC2-5.pdf).",0.8567417504785793,0.33277738094329834,0.14605021476745605,0.23586612939834595

The measurement of cytotoxicity and viability therefore always represents all cells within the migration area. Because of the higher percentage of GFAP-positive radial glia and astrocytes, these two cell types are overrepresented in the assessment of cytotoxicity and viability. The measure of cell viability assessed by the Alamar blue assay (mitochondrial reductase activity) strongly depends on the number of cells in the migration area. Therefore, a reduction in cell number either due to a reduced migration distance or a lower cell number in the migration area will lead to a reduction in the Alamar blue signal despite the cell viability is not necessarily affected (Figure 3 in Nimtz et al. 2019). Therefore, as soon as the migration distance or cell number in the migration area are reduced, the Alamar blue (viability) assay is not used as a measure for viability, but the cytotoxicity assay (based on LDH release) is taken as a reference for the specific DNT endpoints to determine if the effect is specific or not.",Medium,"The answer provides some relevant information about the multicellular system and the challenges in measuring cytotoxicity and viability, particularly highlighting the overrepresentation of certain cell types and the limitations of the Alamar blue assay.

Stock solutions are prepared by diluting the compound in the solvent (e.g. DMSO) in a concentration that allows the preparation of the highest test concentration without exceeding the highest acceptable solvent concentration (see 0). For DMSO the highest acceptable solvent concentration is 0.1% which means that the stock concentration needs to be at least 1000x higher than the highest test concentration.

Depending on the desired concentration range, the dilution can be changed to 1:2, 1:5, 1:10 or other. The SC is prepared by adding the solvent to differentiation media in the same concentration as the highest test concentration. 100 µL of the compound dilutions and the SC are added to a 96-well plate (Figure 4). The serial dilution can also be prepared directly in the 96 well plates. hNPCs are added to each well after a 15 to 30 min equilibration period at 37°C and 5 % CO2. To subtract the background fluorescence of the phenol red-containing medium, 4 wells with medium only (Background, medium without cells, Figure 5) are prepared for the viability and cytotoxicity assays.Figure 5 Plating Scheme.

Coated plates should be stored at 4°C for no longer than 7 days. If different plate types are used, the test system and test method need to be re-established. - Outer wells have to be filled with H2O because of edge effects. - Automating the pipetting steps using a liquid handling system for coating, preparation of the plates, feeding of the plate, viability and cytotoxicity assays reduces the variability and the user bias. Sources of variation: - Pipetting steps: Each pipetting step is a source of variation. Especially in the viability and cytotoxicity assays where the volume pipetted determines the final readout. - ICC: The staining consists of multiple washing steps. As pipetting errors add up in each washing step, there is variation in the dilution of blocking solution and antibodies. - NPC differentiation: The biological variation between the differentiation of different NPC spheres cannot be controlled and can lead to variations in the endpoints neuronal and oligodendrocyte differentiation. Known Pitfalls: - Spill over from the lysis control wells to other wells can happen and needs to be controlled by the operator. It is important to completely empty the 3-day lysis control wells after they have been used and fill them with water, to avoid spill over during the last 2 days of the experiment. - Multiple washing steps in the ICC staining lead to added pipetting errors and may cause differences in the volume in each well.

However, it lacks clarity and completeness in explaining the overall workflow, such as how normalization is consistently applied across different assays, and does not explicitly mention how summary data like EC50 or BMC15 are derived from these steps.","The raw data processing to obtain summary data such as EC50, BMC15, ratios, and PoD involves several systematic steps, starting from background correction to normalization, as described in the assay documentation.

1. Background Correction:
- For endpoints measured via fluorescence (e.g., viability and cytotoxicity), background fluorescence is subtracted from each response value. This background is obtained from wells containing medium only (medium control wells), which are measured to determine baseline fluorescence. The corrected response is calculated as:
  Response (RFU) = Raw response (RFU) – Background (RFU) (Source: Assay description, ""Background correction"" section).

2. Normalization:
- The response data are normalized to the solvent control (SC) median value within each experiment. Each replicate response is divided by the median of the solvent control responses to account for inter-experimental variability. This normalization adjusts for differences in baseline responses across experiments.
- For cytotoxicity assays, normalization is performed using the median of the lysis control (positive control for maximum response) and the solvent control, applying the formula:
  Normalized response = (Lysis control – Response) / (Lysis control – Solvent control) (Source: Assay description, ""Curve fitting"" section).

3. Data Pooling and Curve Fitting:
- The normalized data from independent experiments are pooled, typically by taking the median of replicate values for each concentration.
- The concentration-response data are fitted using the R package drc to identify the best-fit non-linear model based on Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC). This model describes the relationship between concentration and response (Source: Assay description, ""Curve fitting"" section).

4. Derivation of Summary Metrics:
- From the fitted curves, the BMC (Benchmark Concentration) corresponding to a predefined BMR (Benchmark Response) is calculated, along with confidence intervals (BMCU and BMCL).
- Additional parameters such as EC50 are derived from the curve as the concentration corresponding to 50% of the maximal effect, based on the fitted model.
- Ratios and PoD (Point of Departure) are determined from the BMCs and their confidence intervals, providing a quantitative measure of effect potency and threshold (Source: Assay description, ""Prediction model and toxicological application"" section).

In summary, the process involves subtracting medium background fluorescence, normalizing responses to controls, pooling replicate data, fitting concentration-response curves, and extracting key metrics like BMCs and EC50s for further toxicological interpretation.",0.729675884208931,-0.1054704487323761,-0.12660324573516846,-0.11166499555110931
"How are data normally handled to obtain the overall test result (e.g. concentration response fitting using model X, determination of EC50 by method Y, use of EC50 as final data)? How do you model your concentration response curve (e.g. LL.4 parameter fit) and which software do you use (e.g. GraphPad Prism, R, etc.)? Do you usually calculate an uncertainty measure of your summary data (e.g. a 95% confidence interval for the BMC or a BMCL), and with which software? Can you give uncertainty for non-cytotoxicity or no-effect? How do you handle non-monotonic curve shapes or other curve features that are hard to describe with the usual mathematical fit model?","The data is normalized to the SC and re-normalized to the starting point of the curve. For the normalization to the SC each replicate data point is normalized to the median of the SC in the respective experiment. For the cytotoxicity assays the following normalization is used instead of the normalization to the SC. Here again each response value is normalized using the median of the lysis control and the median of the solvent control. lysis control − response normalized response = lysis control − solvent control The R package drc is used to calculate the optimal curve-fit for each experiment (https://github.com/iuf- duesseldorf/fritsche-lab-CRStats; Keßel et al. (pre-print at BioRxiv; doi: 10.1101/2022.10.18.512648). For calculations of curve fits and BMCs, the data from independent experiments is pooled (median of all replicate values for one concentration). Several non-linear models are run with the concentration response data of each endpoint and the Akaike´s information criterion is used to determine the best fit. For re-normalization of the data, the response value of the curves starting point is determined and used to re-normalize all response values. Therefore, each mean response value is divided by the starting point of the curve and multiplied by 100. For the re-normalized response values the curve fitting is repeated to produce the final concentration response curve. For deriving a reference point (RP) or point of departure (Pod) the Benchmark Concentration (BMC) approach, as recommended by the EFSA Scientific Committee (Hardy et al., 2017), is applied. The BMC approach makes use of all data points that define the fitted concentration response curve. Thereby, the BMC is defined as the concentration that is associated with a specific change in response, the Benchmark Response (BMR). The BMR is a value of effect size and should be defined as an effect size that is higher than the general variability of the measured endpoint. The BMR is therefore determined based on the variability of the respective endpoint. BMR for NPC2-5: Primary DNT specific endpoints of the test method are: radial glia migration 72 h (NPC2a) radial glia migration 120h (NPC2a) neuronal migration 120 h (NPC2b) oligodendrocyte migration 120h (NPC2c) BMR30 neuronal differentiation 120 h (NPC3) neurite length 120 h (NPC4) neurite area 120 h (NPC4) BMR10 BMR10 BMR30 BMR30 BMR30 BMR30 oligodendrocyte differentiation 120h (NPC5) BMR30 Secondary endpoints are: cell number 120 h BMR30 cytotoxicity 72 h BMR10 cytotoxicity 120 h BMR10 viability 120 h BMR30 Based on the BMR and the concentration response curve, the evaluation tool calculates the BMC, as well as upper and lower confidence limits (BMCU and BMCL respectively) based on the predict function in the R package drc. The predict function calculates the prediction bands around the concentration response curve based on the deviation between independent experiments and gives an estimation of the area that is expected to enclose 95% of future data points. The BMCL is thereby defined as the intersection of the lower band and the BMR while the BMCU is defined as the intersection of the upper band and the BMR. The confidence intervals are used to access the uncertainty of the BMC. If the BMCU is 1.5 times above the test range, the original BMCU is replaced by 1.5x the highest tested concentration.",High,"The answer comprehensively addresses the question by detailing the data handling process, including normalization and re-normalization methods, the use of the R package 'drc' for curve fitting, and the application of the BMC approach for deriving reference points.

"What is the scientific rationale to link test method data to a relevant in vivo adverse outcome? Which toxicological target (organ, tissue, physiological/biochemical function, etc.) is modelled?

Which toxicological events (e.g. oxidative stress, cell death) are modelled/reflected by your test method? To which (human) adverse outcome(s) is your test method related? Which hazard(s) do(es) your test method (potentially) predict?","Primary hNPCs are isolated from the fetal brain and can be used to model neurodevelopmental processes like migration of radial glia, neurons and oligodendrocytes, neurite outgrowth and differentiation into neurons and oligodendrocytes within this test method. The test system therefore measures adverse events in the young (fetal) developing brain. Thereby, the biological processes that are modeled are: 1. radial glia cell migration (NPC2a) 2. migration of young cortical neurons (NPC2b) 3. oligodendrocyte migration (NPC2c) 4. fetal neuronal differentiation into young neurons (NPC3) 5. neurite outgrowth of young fetal neurons (NPC4) 6. oligodendrocyte formation of fetal NPC (NPC5) The toxicological events that are modeled include events that impact the above-mentioned biological processes in any direction (increase or decrease). Thereby, neurodevelopmental processes represented by the NPC2-NPC5 assay are guided by a variety of pathways known to contribute to the respective processes in vivo as assessed by hNPC exposure to in vivo relevant signaling pathway modulators (summarized in Table13, Masjosthusmann et al. 2020; Koch et al., 2022). All the endpoints can be assessed in a high content format within one experiment due to the multi-cellularity and high developmental dynamic of the neurospheres. In addition, the strength of the system is that it allows KE-based assessment of human neurodevelopment without the need to perform species extrapolation. Moreover, the self-organized mixed culture system contains cell-cell interactions e.g. via gap junction channels as cells die when cell-cell communication is blocked by gap junction blockers (unpublished observations). Hence, the system is superior to single-cell 2D systems, since due to its nature it mimics a multitude of neurodevelopmental processes. One limitation of the hNPC model is the restricted timing. These endpoints represent early processes of neurodevelopment during the fetal period. Neurons stay immature hence later processes like synaptogenesis cannot be studied. Moreover, correct positioning, like one can study in vivo with cortical layering, cannot be studied here, since the assay mimics cortical radial glia and neuronal migration but does not cortical layer formation. The test method predicts the hazard of a chemical to induce developmental neurotoxicity by causing neurophysiological, functional and behavioral changes in the developing nervous system.",High,"The answer comprehensively addresses the scientific rationale by detailing the biological processes and toxicological events modeled by the test method, such as neurodevelopmental processes and cell migration. It specifies the toxicological targets and adverse outcomes related to human neurodevelopment, and it explains the hazards the test method predicts, such as developmental neurotoxicity. The answer also discusses the strengths and limitations of the model, providing a complete and relevant response to the question.","The scientific rationale for linking the NPC2-5 assay data to a relevant in vivo adverse outcome is based on its ability to model key neurodevelopmental processes that are critical during brain development. Disruption of these processes can lead to cognitive dysfunction, which is a relevant adverse outcome in humans (Source: NPC2-5.pdf). The toxicological target modeled by this test method is the developing human brain, specifically focusing on processes such as neural progenitor cell migration and differentiation.

The biological processes reflected by this test method include radial glia migration, neuronal migration, oligodendrocyte migration, neuronal differentiation, neurite outgrowth, and oligodendrocyte formation. These processes are essential for proper brain development and are modeled through migration assays and differentiation endpoints (Source: NPC2-5.pdf).

The toxicological events modeled include disturbances in cell migration and differentiation, which can be caused by adverse effects on signaling pathways, ECM interactions, or cellular functions. The assay also assesses general cytotoxicity and viability, which reflect cell health and integrity (Source: NPC2-5.pdf).

This test method is related to adverse outcomes such as cognitive dysfunction in humans, as it models early neurodevelopmental processes that, if disturbed, can impair brain structure and function. It potentially predicts hazards that interfere with cell migration and differentiation during brain development, which are key events in neurodevelopmental toxicity (Source: NPC2-5.pdf).",0.8406863462556441,0.12144573032855988,0.2540755569934845,0.18752314150333405
"Provide the statistics of your benchmark response (threshold and variance): (i) For dichotomized data, provide your prediction model. When do you consider the result as toxic or not toxic?

Is there a toxicological rationale for the threshold settings and definitions of your prediction model? What are the limitations of your prediction model? What is a ‘hit’ if the test is used in screening mode (= hit definition, if different from above)?","Two prediction models (PM) are applied for the NPC2-5 assay. One PM for a downregulation (PM downregulation) and one PM for an upregulation (PM upregulation) in cell differentiation and migration. PM down regulation The PM uses hit definition based on comparison of the confidence intervals (CI) for the BMC of the DNT- specific endpoint (BMCs) and the unspecific endpoint (cytotoxicity/viability; BMCus). Thereby the following four hit classifications apply: “no hit” The compound is not defined as hit. “specific hit”: The compound is defined as hit and the CI’s do not overlap, meaning that the upper confidence limit of the specific endpoint (BMCUs) is lower than the lower confidence limit of the unspecific endpoint (BMCLus). The compound is defined as hit and the CI of the specific endpoint overlaps by less than or equal to 10% with the CI of the unspecific endpoint. The compound is defined as hit and the CI of the specific endpoint overlaps by more than 10% with the CI of the unspecific endpoints. “borderline hit”: “unspecific hit” The compound is classified as a hit, if the concentration response curve generates a BMC and if the CI is within the test range. In case the CI spans above the test range, the compound is only classified as hit, if the highest test concentration is significantly different from the lowest test concentration. The adjusted significance (p<0.05) is thereby determined using a Tukey HSD test. The decision process for the prediction model is described in the flow chart in Figure 11. Figure 11: Decision tree for the PM for downregulation applied for test method NPC2-5. Overview of the decisions leading to the classification of a compound in one of four categories: “no hit”, “specific hit”, “borderline hit” and “unspecific hit”. Specific consideration for the prediction model: In case no confidence limits are available for the unspecific endpoint because the BMR is not reached, the BMCLus is assumed to be the highest tested concentration. If the CI of the specific endpoint spans above the test range for a compound identified as “hit” based on statistical significance, expert judgement is applied to define, if the “hit” is specific or unspecific. Therefore, all datapoints of the unspecific and specific endpoint of the highest test concentration are compared. If these data points do not overlap, the compound is classified as “specific hit”, otherwise as “unspecific hit”. In general, BMCs based on the same BMR are compared (e.g. BMC30us vs BMC30s). In case the BMC30us is not available for an endpoint that allows the generation of a BMC10us, the BMC10us is used instead. If the classification of this comparison is “unspecific hit”, the compound will be flagged as “check manually“ as the BMC10us is lower than the BMC30us leading to a higher probability of a false classification. To avoid such false classification expert judgement is needed. Compounds can also be flagged as “check manually”, if the classification based on the viability is different from the classification based on the cytotoxicity and if the confidence interval is very wide (BMCU/BMCL > 25), which means a high uncertainty for the BMC estimation. In both cases expert judgement is needed to decide on the classification. The expert judgement is an individual decision process, that accounts for effect size, curve progression, statistical significance and overall standard deviation. If the concentration response curves do not give enough information for decision by expert judgement, additional testing or testing in a different concentration range should be performed. For compounds that reduce the cell number or radial glia migration the viability is not used as unspecific endpoint. The reason is that an effect in both endpoints indirectly affects cell viability. In this case only the cytotoxicity is used for the classification. PM upregulation In contrast to the PM for downregulation, the PM for upregulation is based on a hit definition without the comparison of confidence intervals (CI) between the specific and unspecific endpoint. The reason is that specific and unspecific endpoint do not have the same relationship during an induction compared to a reduction in the endpoint. A loss in general cell health will likely result in an effect in e.g cell migration or differentiation, while an induction in cell health (measured as mitochondrial activity) does not necessarily increase these endpoints. The following three hit classifications apply: “no hit” The compound is not defined as hit. “specific hit”: The compound is defined as hit and the effect is not an artifact due to loss in cell health. “unspecific hit” The compound is defined as hit in only the unspecific endpoints. The compound is classified as hit, if the concentration response curve generates a BMC and if the CI is within the test range. In case the CI spans above the test range, the compound is only classified as hit, if the highest test concentration is significantly different form the lowest test concentration. The adjusted significance (p<0.05) is thereby determined using a Tukey HSD test. The decision process for the prediction model is described in the flow chart in figure 7. Figure 7: Decision tree for the PM for upregulation applied for test method NPC2-5. Overview of the decisions leading to the classification of a compound in one of three categories: “no hit”, “specific hit”, and “unspecific hit”. In case a compound is classified as hit together with a reduction in an unspecific endpoint, it needs to be clarified if the induction is a specific effect or an artifact due to a loss in cell viability or an increase in cytotoxicity. Therefore, expert judgement is applied which accounts for effect size, curve progression, statistical significance, overall standard deviation but also morphological changes of the spheres. Expert judgement is additionally applied if the confidence interval is very wide (BMCU/BMCL > 25) which means a high uncertainty for the BMC estimation.",Medium,"The answer provides a detailed description of the prediction models for both downregulation and upregulation, including hit classifications and decision processes.

However, it lacks details on specific strengths, weaknesses, comparisons to similar tests, gaps it fills, and tier preference, which are all aspects asked in the question.","Yes, the NPC2-5 assay is intended to be used as part of a test battery for developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) assessment. It is currently recommended to be included in a DNT test battery alongside other assays to provide a comprehensive evaluation of neurodevelopmental hazards (Source: NPC2-5.pdf).

Potential strengths of the system within a test battery include its ability to model key neurodevelopmental processes such as migration and differentiation of human neural progenitor cells, providing mechanistic insights and KE-based assessment of human-specific neurotoxicity pathways. It is particularly useful for generating alerts for neurodevelopmental adverse effects, serving as a mechanistic follow-up to initial screening, and contributing to hazard identification with human relevance (Source: NPC2-5.pdf).

Weaknesses include its restriction to early developmental processes like migration and differentiation, with limited capacity to assess later events such as synaptogenesis, neuronal network formation, or myelination. The assay also exhibits biological variability due to the complex multicellular system and heterogeneity of primary human cells, and it does not cover all neurodevelopmental endpoints, necessitating additional assays for a full DNT profile (Source: NPC2-5.pdf).

Compared to similar in vitro tests, such as 2D neuronal or glial cultures, the NPC2-5 assay offers a more physiologically relevant 3D human model that mimics in vivo processes more closely, especially regarding cell-cell interactions and self-organization. Its performance shows high specificity (100%) but moderate sensitivity (~66.7%), indicating it is reliable for confirming neurotoxic effects but may miss some positives, thus requiring complementary assays for broader coverage (Source: NPC2-5.pdf).

This test fills gaps related to human-specific neurodevelopmental processes, particularly migration and early differentiation, which are not well represented in other assays focusing on proliferation, synaptogenesis, or mature neuronal functions. It is especially suitable for early-tier screening to identify potential hazards, but due to its limited endpoint scope, it should be used in conjunction with other assays covering later developmental stages and additional mechanisms (Source: NPC2-5.pdf).

In summary, the NPC2-5 assay is best utilized as a component of a tiered testing strategy, primarily in early screening tiers to flag potential neurodevelopmental hazards. Confirmatory and mechanistic assays should follow, and it is not recommended as a stand-alone method for comprehensive DNT assessment. Its integration enhances the mechanistic understanding and human relevance of the overall testing battery.",0.783353725797629,0.17020314931869507,-0.10835487395524979,0.01732081174850464
