In the 3- to 4-week expansion period different donors can show differences in their proliferative capacity (spheres need longer, 3 instead of 4 weeks, to reach the acceptable minimum size of 0.2 – 0.5 µm). After the first mechanical dissociation, there are no observable or measurable inter-individual differences. Critical consumables The proliferation medium does not contain serum or serum replacement. The use of EGF and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is critical for sphere growth. FGF contains 1% bovine serum albumin and is thus prone to batch effects. Critical handling The thawing medium contains DMSO in a concentration that affects cell health which is why thawed cells should quickly be diluted in proliferation medium (30 mL of media for one vial of cells). It is recommended to add FGF to the proliferation medium directly before thawing. At the end of week two of the expansion period (see below), the spheres should be transferred to petri dishes coated with poly-(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly-Hema) to prevent cell attachment. Attached cells that are not differentiated can be gently detached using a 1000 µL pipet. To avoid repeated attachment, all cells should be transferred to a new poly-Hema coated petri dish. Medium containing FGF should not be stored longer than 1 week at 4°C. During the first two weeks, the medium should be removed using a 1000 µL pipet to keep the accidental removal of small spheres to a minimum. In addition, removed medium should be kept in a new petri dish under culture conditions until the next feeding day, to transfer accidentally removed spheres back to the culture. The neurospheres should be well distributed in the petri dish to prevent aggregation. This is especially important after mechanical dissociations. It is important to avoid frequent re-opening of the incubators, to ensure constant CO2 and temperature levels. Furthermore, the smallest vibrations can lead to aggregations of neurospheres.

The cells are fed by replacing half the medium with new medium every two to three days (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). At each feeding day, the culture is checked for impurities (e.g. fibers or other debris). Impurities and the removed media are transferred to a new petri dish (waste dish). If spheres are mistakenly sorted out during feeding, they can be rescued and placed back in the original culture dish. After 3-4 weeks, neurospheres reach the acceptable size of 0.2 – 0.5 mm for passaging by mechanical dissociation.

These include the morphological and molecular characteristics of the neurospheres, as well as their proliferative capacity.

Endpoints and parameters considered:
- **Sphere shape and borders:** Neurospheres must display a perfectly round shape with no disintegrated borders to ensure integrity and uniformity (Source: NPC1.pdf).
- **Sphere size:** At day 0, neurospheres should be within the size range of 0.2–0.5 mm in diameter, with approximately 2.6 x 10^3 cells per sphere (Source: NPC1.pdf).
- **Expression of cell type-specific markers:** Differentiated source cells must test positive for TUBB3 (neuronal marker) and GFAP (astrocyte marker) (Source: NPC1.pdf).
- **Viability:** The viability of source cells should be at least 20% (Source: NPC1.pdf).
- **Mycoplasma and contamination status:** Cells must be free of mycoplasma, bacteria, and fungi, with sterility confirmed at shipment and regularly checked (Source: NPC1.pdf).

Important parameters to describe the source material:
- **Sphere morphology and size** at day 0 and during expansion.
- **Expression of neural stem and progenitor markers** (nestin, SOX2, Ki67) to confirm proliferative and undifferentiated status.
- **Proliferative capacity** as indicated by sphere growth and marker expression.
- **Differentiation potential** assessed after transfer to differentiation conditions, indicated by marker expression.

Historical performance:
- When the source cells are used across multiple preparations (e.g., 10 different differentiations), the typical values and variation are:
  - **Sphere size at day 0:** Consistently within 0.2–0.5 mm, with variability depending on donor, but generally maintained within the specified range.
  - **Marker expression:** Positive for nestin, SOX2, and Ki67, with a typical expression level confirmed by FACS analysis.
  - **Viability:** Usually above 20%, with low variability.
  - **Mycoplasma and contamination:** Consistently negative in routine testing.

Actions if acceptance criteria are not met:
- Discard the batch if the sphere shape is irregular or borders are disintegrated.
- If sphere size is outside the 0.2–0.5 mm range, the batch is rejected.
- If marker expression (TUBB3, GFAP) is not positive after differentiation, the batch is rejected.
- If viability falls below 20%, the cells are not suitable for use.
- If contamination is detected, the batch is discarded, and the source is re-verified.

In summary, maintaining strict morphological, molecular, viability, and contamination criteria ensures the quality and reproducibility of the source material for the NPC1 assay.",0.7032447793102905,0.02394508384168148,-0.11292465031147003,-0.044814448803663254

**Known Causes of Variability:**
- **Source cell variability:** Differences in sphere size at day 0 depending on donor, and proliferative capacity differences after expansion, especially during the first mechanical dissociation (Source: NPC1.pdf).
- **Biological heterogeneity:** The complex multicellular nature of neurospheres leads to inherent heterogeneity in sphere composition and size (Source: NPC1.pdf).
- **Inter-individual differences:** Variability across donors affects sphere size and proliferation capacity (Source: NPC1.pdf).
- **Assay endpoints:** Variability in sphere size measurement, BrdU incorporation, viability, and cytotoxicity assays, with intra- and inter-experimental CVs provided (Source: NPC1.pdf).

**Critical Consumables and Batch Effects:**
- **Critical reagents:** Growth factors EGF and FGF are critical for sphere growth; batch effects of FGF, which contains bovine serum albumin, can influence proliferation (Source: NPC1.pdf).
- **Source cells:** Lonza primary human neural progenitor cells are supplied with specific quality criteria, but batch-to-batch differences can impact proliferative capacity (Source: NPC1.pdf).
- **Culture media:** The proliferation medium does not contain serum; variability in media components can affect cell growth.
- **Plate format:** Use of standardized 96-well U-bottom plates and coating with poly-Hema is essential; different plate types may require re-establishment of the assay.

**Critical Handling Steps and Influencing Factors:**
- **Pipetting precision:** Variability can arise from pipetting errors, especially during compound dilutions, media changes, and cell seeding.
- **Timing:** Steps such as medium removal, cell plating, and transfer should be performed quickly and consistently to prevent sphere aggregation or loss.
- **Cell density:** Proper sphere size at plating (0.3 mm) is critical; over- or under-seeding can affect proliferation readouts.
- **Sphere transfer and dissociation:** Mechanical passaging and transfer should be performed carefully to maintain sphere integrity and uniformity.
- **Incubator conditions:** Maintaining constant CO₂ and temperature levels is vital; frequent opening of incubators should be avoided.

**Controls and Expected Values:**
- **Positive controls:** Cultivation without growth factors (EGF and FGF) to demonstrate reduced proliferation; expected to show a significant decrease in sphere size and BrdU incorporation.
- **Negative controls:** Solvent controls (e.g., DMSO at 0.3%) should show consistent proliferation levels within the established acceptable range (e.g., proliferation by area: 1000–3000 pixels/day; BrdU raw values not lower than positive control).
- **Deviation acceptance:** Variability in positive controls is low (CV ~1.1% for proliferation by area; ~10.3% for BrdU), and solvent controls should meet the predefined criteria for each endpoint.

**Recommendations to Increase Reproducibility and Performance:**
- Use standardized, validated source cells and monitor sphere size at day 0 to ensure consistency.
- Employ automated liquid handling systems for compound dilutions, media changes, and assay steps to reduce pipetting errors.
- Maintain strict incubation conditions and minimize incubator opening to ensure stable environment.
- Use the same batch of critical reagents (growth factors, media) across experiments when possible.
- Perform regular calibration and validation of imaging and measurement systems.
- Include multiple technical replicates and controls in each run to monitor assay performance.
- Document all deviations and technical issues thoroughly to identify sources of variability.
- Conduct inter-operator training and, if possible, inter-operator variability assessments to ensure consistent handling.

   - Each well receives one sphere in proliferation medium with growth factors (EGF and FGF).
   - The medium is equilibrated at 37°C, 5% CO₂ for 15–30 min before plating.

3. **Compound Exposure (Day 0 to Day 3):**
   - **Addition of test compounds:** 
     - Compounds are prepared as serial dilutions in proliferation medium with solvent (e.g., DMSO).
     - 100 µL of each concentration, including solvent control (SC), is added to the respective wells.
   - **Medium supplements:**
     - The proliferation medium contains EGF and FGF at the start.

     - Cell viability and cytotoxicity are assessed via fluorescence (resazurin and LDH assays).
     - DNA synthesis (BrdU incorporation) is measured during the last 16 hours of exposure.

5. **Medium Changes and Re-adding Compounds:**
   - **Medium changes:** 
     - Not performed during the 72-hour exposure; the test is conducted without medium renewal.
   - **Re-addition of compounds:** 
     - Not necessary; compounds are added once at the start of the exposure period.

6. **Critical Medium Supplements:**

The primary endpoints include proliferation, measured by sphere size and DNA synthesis, and cell viability/cytotoxicity, assessed via fluorescence-based assays.

For proliferation, two key methods are used:
1. **Proliferation by area (NPC1a):** This involves brightfield microscopy to capture images of the neurospheres at multiple time points (0, 24, 48, 72 hours). The images are analyzed using automated high-content imaging software to quantify sphere size, expressed as the number of pixels (area). The increase in sphere size over time (slope) reflects proliferation.
2. **Proliferation by BrdU incorporation (NPC1b):** BrdU, a thymidine analog, is added during the last 16 hours of exposure. Its incorporation into DNA is measured via a luminescence signal in a multi-plate reader, providing an indirect measure of DNA synthesis and cell proliferation.

Both endpoints are measured in the same wells, following the same exposure conditions, allowing parallel assessment of proliferation and DNA synthesis from the same sample.

For secondary endpoints:
- **Cytotoxicity:** Assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage from damaged cells, using fluorescence detection of the supernatant.
- **Viability:** Measured via mitochondrial activity using resazurin reduction to fluorescent resorufin, also in the same wells after exposure.

**Key steps of the method:**
- Neurospheres are plated in poly-Hema coated 96-well plates, with one sphere per well.
- Test compounds are added in serial dilutions, and the plates are incubated at 37°C/5% CO₂ for 72 hours.
- During incubation, sphere size is monitored via automated brightfield imaging at specified intervals.
- At the end of exposure, BrdU is added for the final 16 hours, and luminescence is measured.
- Simultaneously, cytotoxicity and viability assays are performed on the same wells by adding respective reagents and measuring fluorescence signals.

The quantification algorithms involve:
- For sphere size: automated image analysis software calculates the area (pixels) of each sphere, and the slope of size increase over time is derived.
- For BrdU: luminescence signals are directly proportional to DNA synthesis, measured in relative luminescence units.
- For cytotoxicity and viability: fluorescence intensity readings are normalized against controls, with background subtraction, to quantify membrane integrity and mitochondrial activity, respectively.

It also does not address the quality of in vivo reference data or whether in vivo relevant threshold concentrations are known.","The positive controls used in the NPC1 assay include compounds such as cadmium chloride, dexamethasone, hexachlorophene, chlorpromazine hydrochloride, methylazoxymethanol acetate, all-trans-retinoic acid, tributyltin chloride, and sodium valproate (Source: NPC1.pdf). These compounds are known to cause developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) in humans or in vivo.

The expected data on these positive controls show a significant reduction in neural progenitor cell proliferation, with proliferation levels decreasing to 0% of the solvent control for proliferation by area (NPC1a) and to 0-40% for proliferation by BrdU (NPC1b). The assay's controls for proliferation demonstrate a clear signal indicating decreased proliferation, with variability characterized by the coefficient of variation (CV). For example, the intra-experimental CV for proliferation by area is approximately 19.4% ± 9.4%, and for BrdU incorporation, about 13.2% ± 5.9% (Source: NPC1.pdf). This variability reflects the assay's precision in detecting proliferation decreases.

In vivo reference data on these positive controls are not explicitly detailed in the document.

(Such data define the background noise of the test method) What is the rationale for the concentration setting of negative controls? Do you use unspecific controls? If yes, indicate the compounds and the respective rationale for their use and the concentration selection.","The solvent control (SC) is used as a negative control that is run on each experimental plate. Each solvent has to be established for its use as a solvent control by comparing the effect of the SC to the effect of medium only. Established solvent controls show the same response as the medium control. The SC is used to assess if the acceptability criteria for NPC1 proliferation are met and for normalization of the compound exposure and the positive control response. Established SCs are: DMSO: 0.3% v/v; 0.2% v/v; 0.1% v/v DPBS: 2% v/v ddH2O: 2% v/v MeOH: 0.1% v/v Other negative control compounds that were identified as negative in this assay and are known to not affect neurodevelopmental endpoints in vivo include (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020): Acetaminophen Amoxicillin Aspirin Buspirone Chlorpheniramine maleate D-Glucitol Diethylene glycol D-Mannitol Doxylamine succinate Famotidine Ibuprofen Metformin Metoprolol Penicillin VK Saccharin Sodium benzoate Warfarin",Medium,"The answer provides a list of chemicals used as negative controls and their concentrations, which partially addresses the question. However, it lacks a detailed explanation of the expected data on these controls, such as signal and its uncertainty, and the rationale for concentration settings. Additionally, it does not clearly address the use of unspecific controls or provide a rationale for their use and concentration selection.","The negative controls used in the NPC1 assay include the solvent control (SC), which is typically the solvent used to dissolve test compounds, such as DMSO, DPBS, ddH2O, or MeOH, at established concentrations (e.g., DMSO at 0.3%, 0.2%, or 0.1%). These controls are expected to produce a baseline signal with minimal biological effect, representing the background noise of the test system. The data from these controls should show responses within a narrow variability range, with the mean response serving as the baseline, and the standard deviation indicating the uncertainty or noise level of the assay endpoints (e.g., proliferation, viability, cytotoxicity). For example, the intra-experimental variation (CV) for solvent controls is approximately 19.4% for proliferation by area and 13.2% for BrdU incorporation, indicating the typical variability expected in negative control measurements (Source: NPC1.pdf).

The rationale for the concentration setting of negative controls is to match the highest solvent concentration used in test conditions, ensuring that any effects observed are due to test compounds and not the solvent itself. This helps establish a baseline for normal cellular responses and variability, which is critical for interpreting test results.

Yes, unspecific controls are used. These include compounds known not to affect neurodevelopmental endpoints, such as acetaminophen, amoxicillin, aspirin, buspirone, chlorpheniramine maleate, D-glucitol, diethylene glycol, D-mannitol, doxylamine succinate, famotidine, ibuprofen, metformin, metoprolol, penicillin VK, saccharin, sodium benzoate, and warfarin. These compounds are selected because they are not expected to interfere with cell proliferation or neurodevelopmental processes in vivo, serving as negative controls to define the assay’s specificity. The concentrations for these negative controls are typically set based on their solubility and internal exposure relevance, ensuring they do not produce effects that could confound the interpretation of test results (Source: NPC1.pdf).",0.877209174285299,0.3392729163169861,0.20450006425380707,0.2714598774909973

However, it lacks clarity on how the decision is documented and does not specify actions if the acceptance criteria are not met.","The rule applied to test whether a test run is within the normal performance frame is the assessment of the assay's variability and acceptance criteria (AC) for the endpoints, such as proliferation by area, BrdU incorporation, viability, and cytotoxicity.

The test conditions are prepared in a serial dilution from the stock solution (Figure 4). Stock solutions are prepared by diluting the compound in the solvent (e.g. DMSO) in a concentration that allows the preparation of the highest test concentration without exceeding the highest acceptable solvent concentration (see 0). For DMSO the highest acceptable solvent concentration is 0.3% which means that the stock concentration needs to be at least 1000x higher than the highest test concentration. Stock solutions in non-sterile solvents (e.g. water or PBS) have to be sterile filtrated using a sterile syringe filter (diameter = 0.2 µm). Adsorption to the filter needs to be considered. Stock solutions are aliquoted and stored at -20°C. A stock solution is not thawed more than three times. For the preparation of the test condition, the stock solution is diluted to the highest test concentration (default 1:1000) in proliferation medium. All following dilutions are prepared by serial dilution of the highest concentration in proliferation medium with solvent (in the concentration of the highest test concentration). The default serial dilution is 1:3 which covers a concentration range from e.g. 20 µM to 27 nM (729-fold). Depending on the desired concentration range, the dilution can be adjusted to 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, or other. The SC is prepared by adding the solvent to proliferation medium in the same concentration as the highest test concentration. 100 µL of the compound dilutions and the SC are added to each well of a 96 well plate (Figure 4). Alternatively, the serial dilution can be prepared directly in the 96 well plates. One hNPC sphere is added to each well after the medium equilibrated for 15 to 30 min at 37°C and 5% CO2. To subtract the background fluorescence of the phenol red-containing medium, 4 wells with medium only (Background, without cells, Figure 4) are prepared for the viability and cytotoxicity assays.

Data processing describes all processing steps of raw data that are necessary to obtain the final response values including the normalization, curve fitting and benchmark concentration calculation. Processing (or pre-processing) steps depend on the endpoint and are described below: Proliferation by BrdU: subtraction of mean BrdU background from each raw response value.

However, it lacks comprehensive information on normalization steps and how summary data like EC50 or PoD are specifically derived. The description is not fully clear or complete for all processing steps.","The raw data processing in the NPC1 assay involves several steps to derive summary data such as EC50, BMC15, ratios, and PoD, starting from background correction to normalization. 

For endpoints measured by fluorescence or luminescence (viability, cytotoxicity, BrdU incorporation), the raw data are first corrected by subtracting the mean background response obtained from wells containing medium only (background correction). Specifically, the background response (e.g., from wells without cells) is subtracted from each raw response value to account for non-specific signals (Source: NPC1.pdf).

Next, normalization is performed relative to controls. For proliferation endpoints, the data are normalized to the solvent control (SC) by dividing each median replicate response by the median response of the SC, effectively setting the solvent control to 100%. This normalization accounts for variability between experiments and allows comparison across different plates and conditions (Source: NPC1.pdf).

For cytotoxicity and viability endpoints, responses are also normalized by subtracting the background and then normalized to the respective controls, such as the lysis control for cytotoxicity or the untreated control for viability, to express responses as a percentage of maximum response or as relative values (Source: NPC1.pdf).

Subsequently, the normalized data are used for curve fitting using the R package drc, where non-linear models are applied to the concentration-response data. The best-fit model is selected based on the Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC). From these fitted curves, parameters such as EC50, BMC15, and other points of departure (PoD) are derived, with the BMCs calculated based on a predefined Benchmark Response (BMR) for each endpoint (Source: NPC1.pdf).

In summary, the processing steps are:
1. Measure raw responses (fluorescence, luminescence).
2. Subtract background responses from medium-only wells.
3. Normalize responses to solvent controls or untreated controls.
4. Use normalized data for curve fitting with non-linear models.
5. Derive summary metrics such as EC50, BMC15, and PoD from the fitted curves.

All these steps ensure that the data are corrected for non-specific signals, standardized across experiments, and suitable for quantitative analysis of concentration-response relationships.",0.7498948654800184,0.09754888713359833,0.026142947375774384,0.06450571119785309
"How are data normally handled to obtain the overall test result (e.g. concentration response fitting using model X, determination of EC50 by method Y, use of EC50 as final data)? How do you model your concentration response curve (e.g. LL.4 parameter fit) and which software do you use (e.g. GraphPad Prism, R, etc.)? Do you usually calculate an uncertainty measure of your summary data (e.g. a 95% confidence interval for the BMC or a BMCL), and with which software? Can you give uncertainty for non-cytotoxicity or no-effect? How do you handle non-monotonic curve shapes or other curve features that are hard to describe with the usual mathematical fit model?","The data is normalized to the SC and re-normalized to the starting point of the curve. For the normalization to the SC the median of each replicate data point is normalized to the median of the SC in the respective experiment. For the cytotoxicity assays the following normalization is used instead of the normalization to the SC. Here again each response value is normalized using the median of the lysis control and the median of the solvent control. lysis control − response normalized response = lysis control − solvent control The R package drc is used to calculate the optimal fit for each experiment. For calculations of curve fits and BMCs, the data from independent experiments is pooled (median of all replicate values for one concentration). Several non-linear models are run with the concentration response data of each endpoint and the Akaike´s information criteria is used to determine the best fit. For re-normalization of the data, the response value of the curves starting point is determined and used to re-normalize all response values. Therefore, each mean response value is divided by the starting point of the curve and multiplied with 100. For the re-normalized response values the curve fitting is repeated to produce the final concentration response curve. For deriving a reference point (RP) or point of departure (Pod) the Benchmark Concentration (BMC) approach as recommended by the EFSA Scientific Committee (Hardy et al., 2017) is applied. The BMC approach makes use of all data points that define the fitted concentration response curve. Thereby, the BMC is defined as the concentration that is associated with a specific change in response, the Benchmark Response (BMR). The BMR is a value of effect size and should be defined as an effect size that is higher than the general variability of the measured endpoint. The BMR is therefore determined based on the variability of the respective endpoint. BMR for NPC1: proliferation by area BMR30 proliferation by BrdU BMR30 cytotoxicity 72 h BMR10 viability 72 h BMR30 Based on the BMR and the concentration response curve, the evaluation tool calculates the BMC, as well as upper and lower confidence limits (BMCU and BMCL respectively) based on the predict function in the R package drc. The predict function calculates the prediction bands around the concentration response curve based on the deviation between independent experiments and gives an estimation of the area that is expected to enclose 95% of future data points. The BMCL is thereby defined as the intersection of the lower band and the BMR while the BMCU is defined as the intersection of the upper band and the BMR. The confidence intervals are used to access the uncertainty of the BMC. If the BMCU is 1.5 times above the test range, the original BMCU is replaced by 1.5x the highest tested concentration.",High,"The answer comprehensively addresses the question by detailing the data handling process, including normalization and re-normalization methods, the use of the R package 'drc' for curve fitting, and the calculation of BMCs with confidence intervals.

However, it lacks clarity and completeness regarding the specific toxicological targets, the full range of toxicological events modeled, the specific human adverse outcomes related, and the hazards potentially predicted by the test method.","The assay, NPC1, is based on primary human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) derived from the fetal human cortex, which reflect the neurodevelopmental process of NPC proliferation during the fetal period. The scientific rationale for linking test method data to in vivo adverse outcomes is that cortical NPC proliferation is a critical process during brain development; disturbances in this process can lead to alterations in brain development and cognitive dysfunction (Source: ASSAY DESCRIPTION). 

The toxicological target modeled by this assay is the developing human brain, specifically focusing on neural progenitor cell proliferation within the fetal cortex (Source: ASSAY DESCRIPTION). 

The biological processes reflected by the test method include fetal NPC proliferation, assessed through sphere size increase and DNA synthesis (BrdU incorporation), viability, and cytotoxicity (Source: ASSAY DESCRIPTION). These endpoints model key neurodevelopmental processes such as brain growth and cortical expansion during fetal development.

The assay models toxicological events related to adverse effects on cell proliferation, which, if disrupted, may contribute to neurodevelopmental deficits. It does not directly model oxidative stress or cell death but assesses proliferation, viability, and cytotoxicity as secondary endpoints (Source: ASSAY DESCRIPTION).

The adverse outcomes linked to this test method are cognitive dysfunctions resulting from impaired brain development due to disrupted NPC proliferation (Source: ASSAY DESCRIPTION).

What is a ‘hit’ if the test is used in screening mode (= hit definition, if different from above)?","Two prediction models (PM) are applied for the NPC1 assay. One PM for a downregulation (PM downregulation) and one PM for an upregulation (PM upregulation) in cell proliferation. PM downregulation The PM uses hit definition based on comparison of the confidence intervals (CI) for the BMC of the DNT- specific endpoint (BMCs) and the unspecific endpoint (cytotoxicity/viability; BMCus). Thereby the following four hit classifications apply: “no hit” “specific hit”: “borderline hit”: “unspecific hit” The compound is not defined as a hit. The compound is defined as hit and the CI’s do not overlap, meaning that the upper confidence limit of the specific endpoint (BMCUs) is lower than the lower confidence limit of the unspecific endpoint (BMCLus). The compound is defined as hit and the CI of the specific endpoint overlaps by less than, or equal to 10% with the CI of the unspecific endpoint. The compound is defined as hit and the CI of the specific endpoint overlaps by more than 10% with the CI of the unspecific endpoint. The compound is classified as a hit, if the concentration response curve generates a BMC and if the CI is within the test range. In case the CI spans above the test range, the compound is only classified as a hit, if the highest test concentration is significantly different from the lowest test concentration. The adjusted significance (p<0.05) is thereby determined using a Tukey HSD test. The decision process for the prediction model is described in the flow chart in Figure 5. Figure 5: Decision tree for the PM for down regulation applied for the test method NPC1. Overview of the decisions leading to the classification of a compound in one of four categories: “no hit”, “specific hit”, “borderline hit” and “unspecific hit”. Specific consideration for the prediction model: In case no confidence limits are available for the unspecific endpoint because the BMR is not reached, the BMCLus is assumed to be the highest tested concentration. If the CI of the specific endpoint additional spans above the test range for a compound identified as “hit” based on statistical significance, expert judgement is applied to define if the “hit” is specific or unspecific. Therefore, all datapoints of the unspecific and specific endpoint of the highest test concentration are compared. If these data points do not overlap, the compound is classified as “specific hit” otherwise as “unspecific hit”. In general, BMCs based on the same BMR are compared (e.g. BMC30us vs BMC30s). In case the BMC30us is not available for an endpoint that allows the generation of a BMC10us, the BMC10us is used instead. If the classification of this comparison is “unspecific hit”, the compound will be flagged as “check manually“ as the BMC10us is lower than the BMC30us leading to a higher probability of a false classification. To avoid such false classifications, expert judgment is needed. Compounds can also be flagged as “check manually”, if the classification, based on the viability is different from the classification based on the cytotoxicity and if the confidence interval is very wide (BMCU/BMCL > 25), which means a high uncertainty for the BMC estimation. In both cases expert judgment is needed to decide on the classification. The expert judgement is an individual decision process that accounts for effect size, curve progression, statistical significance and overall standard deviation. If the concentration response curves do not give enough information for decision by expert judgement, additional testing or testing in a different concentration range should be performed. PM upregulation In contrast to the PM for downregulation, the PM for upregulation is based on a hit definition without the comparison of confidence intervals (CI) between the specific and unspecific endpoint. The reason is, that specific and unspecific endpoints do not have the same relationship during an induction, compared to a reduction in the endpoint. A loss in general cell health will likely result in an effect on cell proliferation, while an induction in cell health (measured as mitochondrial activity) does not necessarily increase cell proliferation. The following three hit classifications apply: “no hit” The compound is not defined as hit. “specific hit”: The compound is defined as hit and the effect is no artifact due to loss in cell health. The compound is defined as hit in only the unspecific endpoints. “unspecific hit” The compound is classified as hit, if the concentration response curve generates a BMC and if the CI is within the test range. In case the CI spans above the test range, the compound is only classified as hit, if the highest test concentration is significantly different from the lowest test concentration. The adjusted significance (p<0.05) is thereby determined using a Tukey HSD test. The decision process for the prediction model is described in the flow chart in Figure 6. Figure 6: Decision tree for the PM for upregulation applied for the test method NPC1. Overview of the decisions leading to the classification of a compound in one of three categories: “no hit”, “specific hit”, and “unspecific hit”. In case a compound is classified as hit together with a reduction in an unspecific endpoint, it needs to be clarified if the induction is a specific effect or an artifact, due to a loss in cell viability or an increase in cytotoxicity. Therefore, expert judgement is applied, which accounts for effect size, curve progression, statistical significance, overall standard deviation but also morphological changes of the spheres. Expert judgement is additionally applied, if the confidence interval is very wide (BMCU/BMCL > 25) which means a high uncertainty for the BMC estimation.",Medium,"The answer provides a detailed description of the prediction models for both downregulation and upregulation, including hit classifications and decision processes.

The answer is incomplete and lacks clarity on several aspects of the question.","Yes, the NPC1 assay is intended to be used as part of a test battery for developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) assessment. It is currently recommended to be included within a DNT in vitro testing battery, as it addresses a specific neurodevelopmental process—NPC proliferation—complementing other endpoints such as neuronal differentiation, migration, and network formation assessed by different assays (Source: NPC1.pdf).

Potential strengths of the system in a test battery include its high biological relevance for fetal brain development, its validation status with a readiness score A, and its ability to detect adverse effects on cell proliferation, a key process during brain development. It provides mechanistic insight into proliferation-related neurotoxicity and can serve as a good screening tool or confirmation assay for compounds suspected of affecting neurodevelopmental processes (Source: NPC1.pdf).

Weaknesses include its limited scope, as it only assesses proliferation of human neural progenitor cells and does not cover other critical neurodevelopmental endpoints such as neuronal differentiation, migration, or synaptogenesis. Its sensitivity is moderate (33%), indicating it may not detect all neurotoxicants, and it is primarily focused on proliferation, thus requiring other assays to provide a comprehensive DNT profile (Source: NPC1.pdf).

Compared to similar tests, such as the neurosphere assay derived from embryonic stem cells or other 2D proliferation assays, NPC1 offers a more human-relevant model with a validated, mechanistic basis. Its 3D neurosphere format reflects in vivo tissue features more closely than 2D monolayer systems, potentially improving predictive capacity for human neurodevelopmental toxicity (Source: NPC1.pdf).

The assay fills a gap by providing a human-specific, proliferation-focused endpoint that is validated and ready for integration into a tiered testing strategy. It is particularly useful in later tiers for mechanistic confirmation or in early screening to flag compounds for further testing.

In terms of tier placement, the NPC1 assay is best suited as a second-tier or follow-up test after initial screening with broader, less specific assays. It can also be part of a battery that includes endpoints for differentiation, migration, and network formation, providing a mechanistic context for observed effects. It is not recommended as a stand-alone method for comprehensive DNT assessment but rather as a component of an integrated testing strategy requiring complementary assays for a full neurodevelopmental hazard profile (Source: NPC1.pdf).",0.7491595997725328,0.2140224725008011,-0.06709803640842438,0.060026463121175766
