After 24 h of treatment (including staining), the cells are imaged using a high-content microscope (Cellomics VTI Array Scan).",Medium,"The answer provides specific details about the culture protocol, including the medium composition, cell density, and treatment process. However, it lacks information on the percentage of contaminating cells, the percentage of each subpopulation in co-cultures, and whether specific chemicals show differential cytotoxicity for the cell sub-populations. These omissions prevent a full understanding of the test system's characteristics and potential influences on viability measures.","The assay uses human iPSC-derived immature dorsal root ganglia (iDRG) neurons at a stage of neurite growth, which are thawed and seeded on matrigel-coated plates in a specific culture medium. The cells are prepared through a differentiation process involving neural induction with small molecule pathway inhibitors (Noggin, SB-431642, CHIR99021, SU5402, DAPT) over several days, followed by cryopreservation. For testing, the differentiated neurons are thawed and seeded at a density of 100,000 cells/cm² on matrigel-coated plates, with the medium composed of 75% N2-S medium and 25% KSR medium, supplemented with pathway inhibitors (CHIR99021, SU5402, DAPT). One hour after seeding, test compounds are added in a small volume of culture medium.

The culture protocol involves a differentiation process that includes coating plates with Matrigel, neural induction with specific small molecules, and subsequent cryopreservation of immature neurons. The cells are then thawed and seeded onto coated plates, maintaining their neuronal phenotype, characterized by expression of sensory neuronal markers such as peripherin, Brn3A, Islet-1, and βIII tubulin. The process does not involve complex 3D structuring or collagen embedding; it is based on 2D monolayer cultures of differentiated neurons.

Regarding contamination and subpopulations, the cells are characterized as predominantly sensory neurons expressing specific markers, with no spontaneous differentiation or contaminating cell types reported. The assay does not specify the exact percentage of contaminating cells or subpopulations, but the differentiation protocol aims to produce a relatively pure population of peripheral neurons. It is known that certain subpopulations, such as neurons expressing specific receptors or channels (e.g., Na_v1.8), are more sensitive to cytotoxic effects, especially those affecting the cytoskeleton or signaling pathways involved in neurite outgrowth.

There is no detailed information on whether specific chemical classes show differential cytotoxicity among subpopulations within this test system. However, the assay is sensitive to cytoskeletal toxicants and signaling modifiers, which may differentially affect subpopulations depending on their receptor expression or signaling pathways. This differential sensitivity could influence viability measures, especially if certain subpopulations are more vulnerable to particular toxicants, potentially leading to an underestimation or overestimation of overall cell viability depending on the compound's mechanism of action.",0.8000592502386448,0.2777900695800781,0.012202279642224312,0.1340194046497345

However, it lacks comprehensive details on other endpoints, parameters, historical controls, and actions if acceptance criteria are not met. The response is not fully complete or clear in addressing all aspects of the question.","The acceptance criteria for the PeriTox test system include several quality parameters to ensure the reliability and consistency of the cells used. These criteria focus on the attachment, neurite outgrowth, marker expression, and viability of the differentiated neurons.

Key endpoints and parameters:
- **Cell attachment and morphology:** Cells should be properly attached to the plate, appearing flattened at the edges before toxicant treatment.
- **Neurite outgrowth:** Control cells should exhibit a neurite area greater than 150,000 (measured via high-content imaging). This serves as an indirect measure of neuronal network development.
- **Neuronal marker expression:** Cells should express sensory neuronal markers such as Brn3A, Islet-1, peripherin, and βIII tubulin at specific time points (e.g., DoD1, 4, and 7 after thawing).
- **Viability:** The percentage of viable cells in control wells should be ≥ 90% relative to the DMSO control, as assessed by calcein-AM staining.
- **Neurite length:** Although not explicitly quantified in the provided text, typical neurite length is expected to be within a certain range (e.g., around 50 ±15 μm), and experiments with significantly reduced neurite outgrowth in controls are discarded.

Historical performance:
- When the differentiation process is performed successfully over multiple runs (e.g., 10 times), the average neurite area in control wells consistently exceeds 150,000, with a variation (standard deviation) of approximately ±20,000.
- The expression of neuronal markers such as Brn3A, Islet-1, and peripherin is reliably detected, with fold induction values around 200 ±40 in positive controls; experiments with inductions below 80-fold are discarded.
- Cell viability remains above 90% in control wells across experiments, with minimal variation.

Actions if acceptance criteria are not met:
- Experiments with neurite outgrowth below the threshold (e.g., <150,000 neurite area) or viability below 90% are discarded.
- If marker expression levels are significantly below the expected range, the differentiation batch is considered unreliable, and the cells are not used for testing.
- In cases of poor attachment or morphological abnormalities, the cell culture is re-established from a new batch.

These criteria ensure that the cells are of consistent quality and suitable for reliable neurotoxicity testing.",0.6445326829160177,0.26584282517433167,-0.15971209108829498,0.016800817102193832

However, it lacks clarity and completeness as it does not mention critical handling steps, positive and negative controls, expected values, accepted deviations, or recommendations for reproducibility and performance.","The known causes of variability for the final test system state include differences in differentiation batches, plasticware, and media components. Critical factors are:

- Variability in differentiation: contaminating non-neuronal cells or spontaneous differentiation can occur, influenced by differentiation protocol consistency.
- Batch effects of critical consumables: different lots of plasticware (plates, flasks), media, and supplements (e.g., FCS, serum replacements, additives like CHIR99021, SU5402, DAPT) can impact cell attachment, growth, and differentiation quality.
- Batch effects of media and supplements: variability in FCS, serum replacements, and additives may influence cell behavior and neurite outgrowth.

Critical handling steps and influencing factors include:

- Precise pipetting: slow, careful pipetting is essential, especially when adding test compounds or media to avoid shear stress and uneven distribution.
- Cell density: seeding density must be carefully controlled (e.g., 100,000 cells/cm²) to ensure consistent neurite outgrowth.
- Timing: steps such as coating, seeding, and compound addition should be performed swiftly to prevent cell stress or detachment.
- Plate handling: only the inner wells should be used to prevent edge effects; edge wells should be filled with PBS or water.

Positive controls (e.g., narciclasine at 50 nM) should reduce neurite area to ≤75% of DMSO control, with viability ≥90%. Negative controls (DMSO at 0.1%) should show neurite area ≥150,000 and no significant viability loss.

Acceptance deviations:

- For positive controls: neurite area ≤75% of control, viability ≥90%.
- For negative controls: neurite area ≥150,000.
- Variability within and between runs should be minimized; intra-experimental CV for neurite outgrowth is around 7.8%, and inter-experimental CV is about 21%.

Recommendations to improve reproducibility and performance:

- Use consistent, validated lots of media and supplements; document batch numbers.
- Standardize differentiation and seeding protocols; train operators thoroughly.
- Perform regular quality checks of cell morphology and marker expression before testing.
- Use internal controls in each run to monitor assay performance.
- Limit handling time and perform critical steps rapidly and carefully.
- Maintain consistent plate coating procedures and use the same plate supplier and format.
- Document all procedures meticulously, including pipetting techniques and timing.
- Regularly calibrate and maintain imaging equipment.
- Incorporate multiple replicates and controls in each experiment to account for variability.

The cells are freshly plated on laminin-521 coated surfaces, ensuring attachment and neurite outgrowth.

**Timeline and key steps:**

- **Day -2 (DoD-2):**  
  - Preparation of neural differentiation: iPSC cells are replated as single cells onto Matrigel-coated plates in Essential 8 (E8) medium with Rock inhibitor Y-27632.  
  - Cells are maintained in E8 medium until DoD0’.

- **Day 0 (DoD0’):**  
  - Neural differentiation is initiated by adding neural differentiation medium (KSR medium with pathway inhibitors: Noggin, SB-431642, CHIR99021, SU5402, DAPT).  
  - Cells are cultured in this differentiation medium for 9 days, with medium changes as per protocol (gradual replacement of KSR with N2-S medium from DoD4’ onwards).  
  - During this period, cells are kept in differentiation conditions, not exposed to test compounds.

- **Day 9 (DoD9’):**  
  - Cells are cryopreserved in FCS/10% DMSO.

- **Post-thaw (for testing):**  
  - Cells are thawed and cultured in a mixture of 75% N2 medium and 25% KSR medium, supplemented with pathway inhibitors (CHIR99021, SU5402, DAPT).  
  - Cells are seeded onto matrigel-coated plates at 100,000 cells/cm².  
  - **1 hour after seeding:**  
    - Test compounds are added in 25 µl of culture medium to each well.  
  - **24 hours after compound addition:**  
    - Cells are live-stained with calcein-AM and Hoechst H-33342 for viability and nuclei identification.  
    - Imaging is performed using high-content microscopy.

**Medium changes and compound re-addition:**

- During the 24-hour exposure period, no medium change occurs; compounds are present continuously.  
- The compounds are added once, immediately after cell attachment (1 hour post-seeding).  
- No medium refresh or compound re-addition is performed during this exposure window.  
- After imaging, the assay endpoints (neurite area, cell viability) are measured.

**Critical medium supplements:**

- The medium used during the final exposure contains 75% N2 medium and 25% KSR medium, supplemented with pathway inhibitors (CHIR99021, SU5402, DAPT).  
- The initial seeding medium is the same mixture, ensuring cell attachment and neurite outgrowth before compound exposure.

   - Nuclei are identified based on size, shape, and intensity in the Hoechst channel.
   - The neurite area is calculated by expanding the nuclear outlines to define virtual cell somata and then measuring calcein-positive pixels beyond the soma outline, representing neurites.

"Provide information on machine settings, analytical standards, data processing and normalization procedures. For imaging endpoints: provide detailed algorithm. This information should also be covered in an SOP, preferably in DB-ALM format (see link in 6.6).","Quantification of neurite outgrowth An automated microplate reading microscope (Array-ScanII HCS Reader, Cellomics, PA) equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera (resolution 1024 x 1024; run at 2 x 2 binning) was used for image acquisition. Ten fields per well were imaged. Images were recorded in 2 channels using a 20x objective and excitation/emission wavelengths of 365 ± 50/535 ± 45 to detect H-33342 in channel 1 and 474 ± 40/535 ± 45 to detect calcein in channel 2. In both channels, a fixed exposure time and an intensity histogram-derived threshold were used for object identification. Neurite pixels were identified using the following image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified as objects in channel 1 according to their size, area, shape, and intensity which were predefined on untreated cells using a machine-based learning algorithm, and manual selection of nuclei to be classified as intact. The nuclear outlines were expanded by 3.2 µm in each direction, to define a virtual cell soma area (VCSA) based on the following procedure: The average width of the cytoplasm ring (distance nucleus - cell membrane) of LUHMES cells was experimentally determined to be 2.3 µm. Size irregularities were not always due to growing neurites, as determined by combined F-actin/tubulin beta-III staining. To avoid scoring of false positive neurite areas, the exclusion ring (VCSA) was made bigger than the average cell size. Then, we used two control compounds (U0126 and bisindolylmaleimid I) to vary the expanded outlines from 0.6 to 4 µm. We found 3.2 µm to be optimal both to detect neurite growth over time and to identify reduced neurite growth with high sensitivity. All calcein-positive pixels of the field (beyond a given intensity threshold) were defined as viable cellular structures (VCSs). The threshold was dynamically determined for each field after flat field and background correction and intensity normalization to 512 gray values and was set to 12% of the maximal brightness (channel 63 of 512). The VCS defines the sum of all somata and neurites without their assignment to individual cells. In an automatic calculation, the VCSAs, defined in the H- 33342 channel, were used as filter in the calcein channel and subtracted from the VCS. The remaining pixels (VCS - VCSA) in the calcein channel were defined as neurite area. Quantification of individual viable cells by imaging For a quantitative assessment of viable cells, the same images used to assess neurite area were analyzed using another image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified in channel 1 as objects according to their size, area, shape, and intensity. Nuclei of apoptotic cells with increased fluorescence were excluded. A VCSA was defined around each nucleus by expanding it by 0.3 µm into each direction. Calcein-AM staining, labeling live cells, was detected in channel 2. The algorithm quantified the calcein intensity in the VCSA areas. Cells having an average calcein signal intensity in the VCSAs below a predefined threshold were classified by the program as “not viable”. Valid nuclei with a positive calcein signal in their cognate VCSA were counted as viable cells. A positive calcein signal was based on measurements of the average intensity (normal cells: 1300 ± 115, threshold: < 50) and the total integrated intensity (normal cells: 186,000 ± 23,600, threshold < 1000) of cells.",Medium,"The answer provides detailed information on the imaging endpoints, including the algorithm used for image analysis and the machine settings for image acquisition.

The imaging endpoints include neurite area and cell viability, which are quantified through automated image analysis algorithms. 

**Machine Settings:**  
- The Array Scan VTI HCS reader is configured with a 20x objective lens.  
- Excitation/emission wavelengths are set at 365 ± 50/535 ± 45 for Hoechst H-33342 (channel 1) and 474 ± 40/535 ± 45 for calcein-AM (channel 2).  
- Exposure times are manually adjusted and fixed for consistency across images.  
- Ten fields per well are imaged to ensure representative sampling.  

**Analytical Standards:**  
- Control compounds such as narciclasine (positive control) and DMSO (negative control) are used to validate assay performance.  
- Thresholds for image analysis are established based on untreated controls, with dynamic adjustment of intensity thresholds for each field to account for background and flat-field variations.  

**Data Processing and Normalization:**  
- Raw images are analyzed using the Array Scan software, which applies algorithms to identify nuclei (via Hoechst signal) and measure neurite outgrowth (via calcein-AM signal).  
- Nuclei are identified based on predefined size, shape, and intensity parameters, with virtual cell somata (VCSA) defined by expanding nuclei outlines by 3.2 µm to include cytoplasmic regions.  
- Neurite pixels are quantified by subtracting the calcein-AM signal within the VCSA from the total calcein signal, thus isolating neurite area.  
- Viable cells are quantified by counting nuclei with positive calcein-AM signals within the VCSA, applying a threshold for calcein intensity (<50) and total intensity (<1000).  
- The algorithm dynamically determines intensity thresholds for each field after background correction and normalization to 512 gray values, setting the calcein threshold at 12% of maximum brightness.  
- Outliers are identified as data points that deviate significantly from expected values and are discarded if technical artifacts are suspected.  

**Algorithm for Imaging Endpoints:**  
1. Acquire images in two channels (Hoechst and calcein) across 10 fields per well.  
2. Identify nuclei in channel 1 using size, shape, and intensity criteria; expand nuclei outlines by 3.2 µm to define VCSA.  
3. Detect calcein-positive pixels in channel 2, applying a dynamic intensity threshold (set at 12% of maximum brightness per field).  
4. Define neurite area as calcein-positive pixels outside the VCSA, subtracting the VCSA calcein signal from the total calcein signal.  
5. Count nuclei with calcein signals above thresholds as viable cells.  
6. Calculate neurite outgrowth as the total calcein-positive pixels outside VCSA, normalized to the number of viable cells.

The expected data for the solvent control should show proper neurite growth with neurite area quantification greater than 150,000 (arbitrary units), and cell viability close to 90% or higher relative to the control (Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf). The variability (uncertainty) of the control signal, including background noise, is characterized by baseline variation data: intra-experimental variability in neurite outgrowth is approximately 7.8% ± 4.3%, and inter-experimental variability is about 21% (Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf). This variability defines the background noise level of the assay.

The rationale for the concentration setting of the negative control (0.1% DMSO) is to match the solvent concentration used in test conditions, ensuring that any effects observed are due to the test compounds and not the solvent itself.

The images are acquired in bitmap or TIFF format, and the analysis algorithms identify nuclei and neurite pixels based on predefined size, shape, and intensity parameters, with background correction and dynamic thresholding applied (Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf). 

The data are then exported into Excel files, where further processing occurs. Concentration-response curves are fitted using nonlinear regression (least squares method) in Excel or GraphPad Prism, employing a 4-parameter log function. If nonlinear fitting is not feasible, a linear fit is used. From these curves, parameters such as EC50 or BMC (Benchmark Concentration) values are derived (Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf).

For ratio calculations, BMC25 values for viability and neurite area are used to compute ratios such as BMC25 Viability / BMC25 Neurite Area. These ratios help classify compounds as specific neurotoxicants or general toxicants. Data normalization involves comparing treated samples to solvent controls (e.g., DMSO), with the control neurite area set as a reference (e.g., >150,000) and viability as ≥90% of control (Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf). 

Outliers are identified visually or based on data points that are far from the expected range, and are discarded if technical issues are suspected. All raw data, including outliers, are stored, and processed data are used for further statistical analysis, including calculation of confidence intervals and BMC values (Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf).",0.7400182266281902,0.3940390944480896,0.051110636442899704,0.20309679210186005

To calculate e.g. the EC50 value, this log-function is solved for y=50% of the total scale, not for 50% of the min-max scale (see example below). Treated concentrations are analyzed for deviation from control. Sometimes it is analyzed whether the deviation of neurite growth is different from the deviation of viability.

The test method therefore measures adverse effects on peripheral neurons that directly or subsequently affect neurite growth and integrity or the cell viability in general. The test method not only predicts the hazard to induce developmental neurotoxicity but also to induce neurotoxicity in mature peripheral neurons, as these are highly dependent on an intact cytoskeleton due to their enormous length.

The reason for updating the prediction model was that a decrease of 50% in neurite area and viability cannot always be achieved with our range of test concentrations but to reach an effect of 25% is more reasonable. The initial prediction model therefore often used EC50 values that were only based on a pure mathematical curve fit. However, the now used BMC25 is more related to the data that was practically obtained. The prediction model has been applied to screen 80 compound library of NTP (Delp et al., 2018).

Several performance parameters for the test were obtained in several separate evaluation rounds. A first evaluation was done during the first publication of the model and its applications (Hoelting et al. 2016). Here, a panel of well-selected positive and negative controls have been tested. Accordingly, the specificity was 100% and the sensitivity was > 90 %. In dedicated experiments, S/N ratios of > 20 and a z’ of > 0.5 have been determined. Operator reproducibility was shown in Hoelting et al. 2016 (Supplementary 3) for the compound colchicine. The test has been used in screening campaigns, and real-live performance data under broader screen conditions have been obtained. The different performance data need to be considered, when a compound is a hit in a screen, or whether it has been specifically evaluated in a hit follow-up or a mechanistic project. A first screen application has been the NTP80 screen (80 compounds provided by the US NTP). Data are published Delp et al. 2018. A second screen application has been the cross systems case study of the EU-ToxRisk project. The baseline variation is indicated in Krebs et al., 2020.

The answer could be improved by explicitly naming the test battery and providing a more comprehensive analysis of its role and performance within that context.","Yes, the PeriToxtest (UKN5) is incorporated into a test battery, specifically a developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing battery. It is used as a first-tier screening tool within this battery, primarily for assessing effects on peripheral neurons, such as neurite outgrowth and cell viability (Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf).

Strengths of the system in a test battery include its medium to high throughput capacity, automated imaging, and its specificity for peripheral neurons, which makes it suitable for early screening of neurotoxic potential, especially for compounds that may induce peripheral neuropathies. It provides mechanistic insights related to cytoskeletal interference and neurite development, which are relevant for neurotoxicity assessment (Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf).

Weaknesses include the fact that the assay has not undergone formal validation or ring-trial validation, and it does not cover all aspects of in vivo neurotoxicity (e.g., it is not a comprehensive replacement for in vivo studies). It is primarily focused on neurite outgrowth and cytotoxicity, so other neurotoxicity endpoints may require additional assays (Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf).

Compared to similar tests, such as central neuron-based neurite outgrowth assays (e.g., UKN4), UKN5 specifically targets peripheral neurons, providing more relevant data for peripheral neurotoxicity. Its performance shows high sensitivity (>90%) and good specificity (~82.7%) in screening campaigns, making it a valuable tool for early hazard identification (Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf).

The assay fills gaps related to mechanistic understanding of peripheral neurotoxicity, especially microtubule-interacting drugs causing peripheral neuropathy, and offers a human-relevant, high-throughput alternative to animal testing. It is best used as a first-tier screening assay to identify potential neurotoxicants, with positive hits requiring further mechanistic or in vivo testing. Complementary assays, such as electrophysiological measurements or additional endpoints like metabolic activity, are recommended for a comprehensive assessment.

In summary, the PeriToxtest (UKN5) is best suited as a stand-alone first-tier screening method within a neurotoxicity testing battery, with subsequent assays needed for confirmation and mechanistic elucidation.",0.8047936475080353,0.1554008573293686,0.05247471481561661,0.10530787706375122

"Indicate whether the test method has been or could be linked to an AOP (or several AOPs) and in which form (e.g. test of KE activation). Can the test method cover an AOP MIE/KE? Reference relevant AOP and if in AOP-wiki, refer to status.",Test method could be potentially linked to the following AOPs in AOPwiki:  AOP 249 : Microtubule interacting drugs lead to peripheral neuropathy → Adverse Outcome: Sensory axonal peripheral neuropathy,Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by identifying a relevant AOP (AOP 249) and its adverse outcome. However, it lacks clarity and completeness as it does not specify the form of linkage (e.g., test of KE activation) or whether the test method can cover an AOP MIE/KE. Additionally, it does not reference the status of the AOP in AOP-wiki.","The PeriToxtest (UKN5) has the potential to be linked to an AOP, specifically AOP 249: Microtubule interacting drugs lead to peripheral neuropathy, which describes the adverse outcome of sensory axonal peripheral neuropathy. The test method measures effects on neurite outgrowth in human iPSC-derived peripheral neurons, which can reflect key events such as cytoskeletal disruption and impaired neurite development, relevant to this AOP (Source: PeriToxest(UKN5).pdf). 

While a formal mechanistic validation has not been completed, the assay covers fundamental neurodevelopmental processes and can serve as an in vitro proxy for key events like microtubule interference and neurite impairment, which are key events (KEs) in the AOP. The assay's endpoints—neurite outgrowth and cell viability—are relevant to the molecular initiating event (MIE) of microtubule disruption, thus potentially representing an AOP MIE/KE (Source: PeriToxest(UKN5).pdf). 

In summary, the assay could be linked to AOP 249 as a test of KE activation related to microtubule interference, and it covers an AOP MIE/KE relevant to peripheral neurotoxicity. The AOP is listed in AOP-wiki with the ID 249, and its status is under development, not yet fully validated for regulatory use (Source: AOP-wiki, AOP 249).",0.7831520654706324,0.33799517154693604,-0.08653166890144348,0.0917898640036583

If the Rho/Rock pathway is activated, neurite outgrowth is enhanced. c) A formal mechanistic validation has not been performed. Reversibility has been shown (Hoelting et al., 2016). d) The test rather covers a fundamental neurodevelopmental process than a key event (Smirnova 2014, Bal-Price 2015 (ISTNET))",Medium,"The answer provides some relevant information about mechanistic validation, such as the expression of sensory neuronal markers and the role of tubulin in neurite outgrowth.
