The differentiation process involves several steps: initially, proliferating LUHMES cells are seeded in proliferation medium (day -1), then the medium is changed to differentiation medium on day 0. On day 2, cells are trypsinized and replated onto 96-well plates in differentiation medium containing galactose instead of glucose, and without additional growth factors such as GDNF or cAMP. The differentiation process results in neurons that extend neurites, express dopaminergic markers, and exhibit electrophysiological activity (section 4.1, 4.6).

The culture protocol is based on a two-step process: proliferation followed by differentiation, with the key differentiation steps involving the switch to galactose medium to increase sensitivity to mitochondrial toxicants. The cells are grown on coated plastic surfaces (coated with poly-L-ornithine and fibronectin) to promote attachment and neurite outgrowth. The protocol does not involve complex 3D structuring or embedding in matrices like collagen; it is a 2D monolayer culture (section 3.6, 4.1).

Regarding contamination and subpopulations, the LUHMES cells are characterized by a high degree of purity, expressing dopaminergic markers such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and are free of pathogens after quality control measures (section 3.4). The cells are not co-cultured with other cell types in this assay, so the population is predominantly a homogeneous dopaminergic neuronal population. The percentage of contaminating cells is minimal, with normal culture conditions expecting about 5-10% cell death, which is considered normal (section 3.4).

There is no specific information indicating that subpopulations within LUHMES cultures show differential sensitivity to cytotoxicity. Since the culture is a relatively homogeneous dopaminergic neuron population, the influence of subpopulation sensitivity on viability measures is likely minimal. However, it is known that neurons with different phenotypes or maturation states can vary in sensitivity to toxicants, especially mitochondrial toxicants, but this is not specifically detailed for subpopulations within LUHMES cultures in the provided context (section 4.7, 4.8).

In summary, the test system involves differentiated LUHMES neurons cultured in a 2D monolayer, with high purity and minimal contamination, and no complex tissue structuring. The protocol emphasizes neurite outgrowth and viability assessment, with no specific subpopulations identified as more sensitive to cytotoxicity within this homogeneous neuronal culture.",0.7768244176086677,0.18811266124248505,-0.044672951102256775,0.06367269158363342

However, it lacks clarity and completeness in some areas. It does not explicitly mention critical handling steps, positive and negative controls, or provide specific recommendations to increase reproducibility and performance. The answer could be improved by including these missing elements and providing more detailed guidance on handling and control measures.","The known causes of variability for the final test system state include issues related to coating, cell passage, plasticware, medium and supplement lots, and cell confluency. Critical factors are:

- **Coating quality:** Problems with PLO/fibronectin batches or water quality can lead to uneven cell distribution and clumping. To mitigate this, plates should be washed twice after coating, and PBS can be used instead of MilliQ water. Plates and flasks should be used immediately after coating without storage in the fridge.

- **Cell passage number:** Cells behave differently with increasing passage number; thus, cells should be used up to passage 18, and a new batch should be thawed periodically to maintain consistency.

- **Plasticware:** Different lots or suppliers of plasticware may influence cell attachment and growth, requiring validation of each new lot.

- **Medium and supplement batches:** Variability in medium components and supplements can affect cell behavior; consistent sourcing and batch testing are recommended.

- **Cell confluency:** Maintaining confluency between 60% and 85% is critical. Over-confluency impairs metabolism and differentiation, while under-confluency can lead to inconsistent responses.

**Critical handling steps and influencing factors:**

- **Pipetting precision:** Handling of test compounds requires careful, trained pipetting, especially when adding compounds to wells to avoid edge effects and ensure uniform exposure.

- **Timing of steps:** Cells should be seeded and compounds added promptly to prevent variability due to delayed attachment or uneven exposure. Compound addition should be performed quickly and consistently.

- **Cell density:** Seeding density (e.g., 30,000 cells/well) must be strictly adhered to, as deviations can influence neurite outgrowth and viability.

**Controls and expected values:**

- **Positive control:** Narciclasine (50 nM) should reduce neurite area to ≤75% of DMSO control and maintain viability ≥90%. Deviations beyond these thresholds indicate reduced assay performance.

- **Negative control:** Solvent (0.1% DMSO) should show neurite area ≥35,000 pixels and maintain normal viability. Significant deviations suggest issues with the assay system.

**Recommendations to improve reproducibility:**

- Use validated, consistent batches of plasticware, media, and supplements.

- Limit passage number and thaw new cell batches regularly.

- Standardize coating procedures and perform water quality checks.

- Train operators thoroughly in pipetting and handling procedures, emphasizing speed and accuracy.

- Include internal controls in each run and monitor their responses to detect drift or variability.

- Document all steps meticulously, including plate maps, compound dilutions, and timing, to facilitate troubleshooting.

- Perform routine validation of the test system’s acceptance criteria at the start and end of each experiment to ensure consistent performance.

The description is somewhat clear but not fully comprehensive.","The exposure scheme for the MitoMet assay (UKN4b) is integrated into the overall cell culture process as follows:

**Overall Cell Culture and Differentiation Timeline:**

- **Day -1:**  
  - Proliferating LUHMES cells are seeded in proliferation medium in T75 or T175 flasks.  
  - Cells are maintained at passages up to 18, with regular medium changes and passaging every 2-3 days.  
  - Coating of flasks with poly-L-ornithine and fibronectin is performed overnight before seeding.

- **Day 0:**  
  - Medium is changed from proliferation medium to differentiation medium containing tetracycline (1 µg/ml), GDNF (2 ng/ml), and db-cAMP (1 mM).  
  - Cells begin differentiation, forming neuronal networks over the next days.

- **Day 2:**  
  - Cells reach approximately 20-30 million per T75 flask.  
  - Cells are trypsinized and replated onto 96-well plates at 30,000 cells/well in differentiation medium with galactose instead of glucose, and without tetracycline, GDNF, and db-cAMP.  
  - **Medium change:** The medium is replaced with galactose-based differentiation medium, which is based on SILAC Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with galactose, L-lysine, L-arginine, phenol red, and L-glutamine.  
  - **Compound addition:** After cells have attached (approximately 30 min to 2 hours), test compounds are added in 10 µl of each dilution (from a pre-prepared serial dilution in medium with 1% DMSO), bringing the total volume to 100 µl per well.

- **Day 3 (24 hours after compound addition):**  
  - Cells are live-stained with calcein-AM (1 µM) and Hoechst H-33342 (1 µg/ml) for viability and nuclei identification.  
  - **Sampling:** The cells are incubated with stains for 30 min at 37°C, 5% CO₂, then imaged using high-content microscopy.

**Key Points in the Exposure Scheme:**

- **Medium Supplements:**  
  - Tetracycline, GDNF, and db-cAMP are present during initial differentiation (Day 0).  
  - During the plating on 96-well plates (Day 2), these supplements are omitted to induce further differentiation in galactose medium.

- **Compound Re-Addition:**  
  - Compounds are added **only once** after cell attachment on Day 2.  
  - No re-addition occurs during medium changes; the compounds are present during the 24-hour exposure period.

- **Medium Changes:**  
  - The initial change from proliferation to differentiation medium occurs on Day 0.  
  - On Day 2, cells are replated onto assay plates with fresh galactose medium containing the test compounds.  
  - No further medium changes are performed during the exposure period; the exposure lasts for approximately 24 hours.

- **Critical Medium Components:**  
  - The switch to galactose medium enhances sensitivity to mitochondrial toxicants.  
  - The medium is supplemented with phenol red (for pH indicator) and L-glutamine, which are critical for cell health and differentiation.

The key steps involve live staining of cells with calcein-AM to mark viable cells and Hoechst H-33342 to identify nuclei. Cells are not fixed; instead, they are stained live and imaged in real-time. The imaging is performed using an automated high-content microscope (Array Scan VTI HCS reader), capturing multiple fields per well in two channels: one for nuclei (UV-Hoechst) and one for calcein (green fluorescence). 

The quantification of endpoints is achieved through image analysis algorithms. For neurite outgrowth, the software identifies nuclei as objects in the Hoechst channel, expands their outlines to define virtual cell somas, and then measures calcein-positive pixels beyond the soma outline to estimate neurite area. The number of viable cells is determined by counting nuclei with positive calcein signal within their defined soma regions. Typically, about ten fields per well are imaged to ensure representative sampling.

Both endpoints—neurite area and cell viability—are measured in the same well and under identical conditions, allowing simultaneous assessment of neuronal connectivity and cell health.

"Provide information on machine settings, analytical standards, data processing and normalization procedures. For imaging endpoints: provide detailed algorithm. This information should also be covered in an SOP, preferably in DB-ALM format (see link in 6.6).","Quantification of neurite outgrowth An automated microplate reading microscope (Array-ScanII HCS Reader, Cellomics, PA) equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera (resolution 1024 x 1024; run at 2 x 2 binning) was used for image acquisition. Ten fields per well were imaged. Images were recorded in 2 channels using a 20x objective and excitation/emission wavelengths of 365 ± 50/535 ± 45 to detect H-33342 in channel 1 and 474 ± 40/535 ± 45 to detect calcein in channel 2. In both channels, a fixed exposure time and an intensity histogram-derived threshold were used for object identification. Neurite pixels were identified using the following image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified as objects in channel 1 according to their size, area, shape, and intensity which were predefined on untreated cells using a machine-based learning algorithm, and manual selection of nuclei to be classified as intact. The nuclear outlines were expanded by 3.2 µm in each direction, to define a virtual cell soma area (VCSA) based on the following procedure: The average width of the cytoplasm ring (distance nucleus - cell membrane) of LUHMES cells was experimentally determined to be 2.3 µm. Size irregularities were not always due to growing neurites, as determined by combined F-actin/tubulin beta-III staining. To avoid scoring of false positive neurite areas, the exclusion ring (VCSA) was made bigger than the average cell size. Then, we used two control compounds (U0126 and bisindolylmaleimid I) to vary the expanded outlines from 0.6 to 4 µm. We found 3.2 µm to be optimal both to detect neurite growth over time and to identify reduced neurite growth with high sensitivity. All calcein-positive pixels of the field (beyond a given intensity threshold) were defined as viable cellular structures (VCSs). The threshold was dynamically determined for each field after flat field and background correction and intensity normalization to 512 gray values and was set to12% of the maximal brightness (channel 63 of 512). The VCS defines the sum of all somata and neurites without their assignment to individual cells. In an automatic calculation, the VCSAs, defined in the H- 33342 channel, were used as filter in the calcein channel and subtracted from the VCS. The remaining pixels (VCS - VCSA) in the calcein channel were defined as neurite area. Quantification of individual viable cells by imaging For a quantitative assessment of viable cells, the same images used to assess neurite area were analysed using another image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified in channel 1 as objects according to their size, area, shape, and intensity. Nuclei of apoptotic cells with increased fluorescence were excluded. A VCSA was defined around each nucleus by expanding it by 0.3 µm into each direction. Calcein-AM staining, labelling live cells, was detected in channel 2. The algorithm quantified the calcein intensity in the VCSA areas. Cells having an average calcein signal intensity in the VCSAs below a predefined threshold were classified by the program as “not viable”. Valid nuclei with a positive calcein signal in their cognate VCSA were counted as viable cells. A positive calcein signal was based on measurements of the average intensity (normal cells: 1300 ± 115, threshold: < 50) and the total integrated intensity (normal cells: 186,000 ± 23,600, threshold < 1000) of cells.",Medium,"The answer provides detailed information on the imaging equipment, settings, and algorithms used for neurite outgrowth quantification and viable cell assessment.

- Nuclei are identified based on predefined size, shape, and intensity parameters
- Virtual cell soma areas (VCSA) are generated by expanding nuclei outlines by 3.2 µm to include cytoplasmic regions
- Neurite pixels are identified by expanding the nuclei outlines by 3.2 µm and subtracting the VCSA from the calcein-AM signal to quantify neurite area
- Viable cells are quantified by counting nuclei with positive calcein-AM signals within the VCSA

**Algorithm for Imaging Endpoints:**
1. **Nuclei Identification:** Use size, shape, and intensity parameters to detect nuclei in channel 1.
2. **VCSA Generation:** Expand each nucleus outline by 3.2 µm to define the virtual cell soma area.
3. **Neurite Area Measurement:** 
   - Detect calcein-AM positive pixels in channel 2.
   - Apply a dynamic intensity threshold (set at 12% of maximum brightness) after background correction.
   - Subtract the VCSA from the calcein-AM signal to isolate neurite pixels.
4. **Viable Cell Counting:** 
   - Count nuclei with calcein-AM intensity above the threshold within each VCSA.
   - Classify these nuclei as viable cells.

The expected data for this positive control are a neurite area less than or equal to 75% of the DMSO control, indicating significant neurite growth inhibition, while cell viability should be maintained at 90% or higher of the DMSO control, reflecting that the effect is specific to neurite outgrowth rather than general cytotoxicity (Source: EFSA Journal 2023:7794). The variability of the positive control across multiple assay runs shows a mean neurite area reduction to about 40-75% of control with a positive control response variability (inter-experimental variation) of approximately 38.5%, indicating moderate to high consistency, but some inherent uncertainty exists (Source: EFSA Journal 2023:7794). 

Regarding in vivo reference data, the document states that the assay has not undergone formal validation and has not been part of a ring trial, implying limited or no established in vivo reference thresholds for the positive controls (Source: EFSA Journal 2023:7794).

It lacks clarity and completeness in addressing the question.","The negative controls used in the assay include solvent (0.1% DMSO), mannitol, paracetamol, ASS, and galloflavin (Source: EFSA NAMs Case Study on Tebufenpyrad, Part 2 – Annex A).

The signal from negative controls reflects the background noise of the test method, with variability (uncertainty) typically characterized by intra- and inter-experimental baseline variation, which is around 11.7% ± 4.5% intra-experimentally and approximately 15.3% inter-experimentally (Source: EFSA NAMs Case Study on Tebufenpyrad, Part 2 – Annex A).

The rationale for the concentration setting of negative controls is to use the solvent at a final DMSO concentration of 0.1%, which is considered non-toxic and does not interfere with the endpoints measured. For other negative controls like mannitol, paracetamol, ASS, and galloflavin, concentrations are chosen based on their known non-toxic or non-specific effects at relevant doses, ensuring they do not induce neurite impairment or cytotoxicity, thus establishing a baseline or background signal (Source: EFSA NAMs Case Study on Tebufenpyrad, Part 2 – Annex A).

Yes, unspecific controls are used, including compounds such as mannitol, paracetamol, ASS, and galloflavin, to account for non-specific effects and to define the background noise level of the assay.

However, it does not clearly address the possibility or extent of repeated measures over time from the same dish, which is part of the question. The explanation is somewhat complex and could be clearer in terms of how repeated measures are handled.","The assay can generate approximately 1,200 data points per month, assuming three working weeks per month. This estimate is based on the following considerations:

- Each data point corresponds to one concentration of a compound tested in one technical replicate (see section 5.10).
- The typical plate layout involves 5 compounds with 10 concentrations each, totaling 50 data points per plate.
- Three plates are used for three technical replicates per condition, resulting in 150 data points per run.
- With six plates processed per day, this yields about 900 data points daily.
- Over a month (roughly 4 weeks), this accumulates to approximately 1,200 data points (section 5.10).

Controls necessary for calibration and acceptability are not counted as data points, and all technical replicates for a given condition are counted as a single data point (section 7.2). 

Regarding repeated measures over time from the same dish, the protocol allows for longer or later exposures (section 6.8), and the assay can be adapted for repeated measurements, but typically, each measurement is independent, and the protocol does not specify multiple time points from the same dish within a single experiment.

Day-to-day procedures are documented through detailed lab notebooks and digital records, including plate maps and experimental protocols, which are stored in lab-specific files and SOPs, such as the DB-ALM Protocol no 200 (see section 6.6). 

For calculating test compound concentrations, the process involves preparing serial dilutions in a deepwell plate, typically using a 1:3 dilution series (section 6.4). The initial stock solutions are aliquoted into volumes sufficient for one experiment to prevent stability issues, then diluted with galactose medium (section 6.1). The serial dilutions are performed in a separate deepwell plate, with concentrations calculated beforehand based on the initial stock and dilution factors, and documented in the lab book or digital files.

The serial dilutions are prepared in a separate deepwell plate, starting from a stock solution in DMSO, with the highest concentration being the undiluted stock, and subsequent dilutions made with medium containing 1% DMSO to maintain consistency. The serial dilution process ensures a wide range of concentrations to capture potential dose-response effects (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf).

There is a rule for the starting dilutions: the highest concentration is usually the maximum solubility or a concentration that is expected to be non-toxic, and the serial dilutions are performed to cover several orders of magnitude, often with a 1:3 or similar factor, to enable detection of both potent and weak effects. The exact dilution factor can be adapted depending on the compound's solubility and expected potency.

For endpoints that may not produce a full concentration-response curve, such as gene expression or mechanistic endpoints, the test concentrations are often based on the BMC (Benchmark Concentration) estimates derived from the dose-response data, such as BMC10, BMC25, or BMCL (lowest BMC). These are calculated from the dose-response data and used to define relevant concentrations for further mechanistic or gene expression testing. When applying these endpoints, the concentrations tested are selected to include the BMC estimates and their confidence intervals, ensuring that the relevant biological effect levels are covered (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf).

The processing steps include:  
1. Background correction: Images are corrected for background and flat-field effects before analysis.  
2. Identification of objects: Nuclei are identified as objects in channel 1 (Hoechst staining) based on size, shape, and intensity, with predefined thresholds.  
3. Virtual cell soma area (VCSA) creation: Nuclear outlines are expanded by 3.2 µm to define a VCSA, which helps in measuring neurite area and viability.  
4. Neurite area measurement: Pixels beyond the VCSA in the calcein-AM channel are summed to determine neurite outgrowth.  
5. Viable cell quantification: Calcein-AM intensity within the VCSA is measured; cells with intensity below a threshold are classified as non-viable, and those above as viable.  
6. Data normalization:  
   - The neurite area and cell viability data are normalized to the respective negative control (solvent control, e.g., DMSO).  
   - The medium control (without treatment) serves as the baseline for 100% neurite outgrowth and viability.  
   - Treated samples are expressed as percentage of the control to account for inter-plate variability.  

7. Calculation of summary metrics:  
   - Dose-response curves are fitted using nonlinear regression (least squares) to derive parameters such as EC50 or BMC (Benchmark Concentration) values like BMC15, BMC25, etc.  
   - Ratios such as BMC25 Viability / BMC25 Neurite Area are calculated to assess neurotoxicity.  
   - PoD (Point of Departure) values are derived from the fitted curves, representing the concentration at which a predefined effect level (e.g., 25% reduction) is observed.

A first evaluation was done during the first publication of the model and its applications (Stiegler et al. 2011, Krueg et al. 2013). Here, a panel of well-selected positive and negative controls have been tested. Accordingly, the specificity was 100% and the sensitivity was > 90 %. In dedicated experiments, S/N ratios of > 20 and a z’ of > 0.5 have been determined.

The neurite area relative to the solvent control varied between 40% and 75% across all plates with a viability value constantly >90% (Delp et al. 2018). The test has been used in screening campaigns, and real-live performance data under broader screen conditions have been obtained. The different performance data need to be considered, when a compound is a hit in a screen, or whether it has been specifically evaluated in a hit follow-up or a mechanistic project. A first screen application has been the NTP80 screen (80 compounds provided by the US NTP). Data are published Delp et al. 2018. A second screen application has been the cross systems case study of the EU-ToxRisk project. The baseline variation is indicated in Krebs et al., 2020. Moreover, an overview is given for 19 compounds on the BMC/BMCL ratio as measure of readout certainty. A third screen was performed in the context of the EFSA DNT test battery evaluation with 120 compounds (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020).

It was assumed that the lowest test concentration does not affect any of the endpoints measured. E: Variation of a positive control run on each (inter-experimental) is the variability of the positive control across all independent experiments (n>40) after normalization.

**Strengths and Weaknesses in a Test Battery:**
- **Strengths:**  
  - Medium to high throughput with automated microscopy, making it suitable for screening large compound libraries (Source: EFSA Journal 2023).  
  - Sensitive to mitochondrial toxicants, which are relevant for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental outcomes (Source: EFSA Journal 2023).  
  - Provides mechanistic insights related to mitochondrial function and neurite outgrowth, supporting mechanistic interpretation and follow-up studies (Source: EFSA Journal 2023).  
  - Can be used as a confirmation assay due to its mechanistic relevance and sensitivity to specific toxicants.

- **Weaknesses:**  
  - Not formally validated or part of an OECD validation process, which may limit regulatory acceptance (Source: EFSA Journal 2023).  
  - Focused on dopaminergic neurons, so it may not detect toxicants affecting other neuronal subtypes or non-neuronal tissues.  
  - It does not cover all aspects of neurotoxicity, such as synaptic function or long-term effects, without additional assays.

**Comparison to Similar Tests:**
Compared to other in vitro neurotoxicity assays, such as the UKN4 assay (which measures neurite outgrowth in mature neurons), the UKN4b (MitoMet) assay is more sensitive to mitochondrial toxicants and early developmental effects. It fills a gap by specifically modeling mitochondrial impairment in dopaminergic neurons, which are relevant for Parkinsonian toxicants, whereas other assays may focus on general neurotoxicity or different neuronal subtypes.

**Gaps Filled and Tier Placement:**
The assay addresses gaps related to mitochondrial toxicity and early neurodevelopmental effects in dopaminergic neurons, which are not always covered by other neurotoxicity assays. It is suitable for later tiers of testing, such as screening and mechanistic follow-up, rather than initial broad screening, due to its specificity and the need for specialized equipment and expertise. It can serve as a mechanistic follow-up to initial screening assays that detect general neurotoxicity or cytotoxicity.

**Use in a Testing Strategy:**
The MitoMet assay should be used as a complementary assay within a tiered testing strategy. It is not recommended as a stand-alone method for comprehensive neurotoxicity assessment but rather as part of a battery that includes general neurotoxicity, developmental neurotoxicity, and mechanistic assays. Its sensitivity to mitochondrial toxicants makes it particularly valuable in later tiers for hazard characterization and mechanistic understanding.",0.7147669289035524,0.1488245129585266,-0.07069557160139084,0.03214673325419426

The response is partially complete but lacks specific details and clarity required for a 'High' score.","The test method could potentially be linked to several AOPs in the AOPwiki, particularly those related to neurotoxicity and neurodevelopmental outcomes. It models neurite outgrowth as a biological process and assesses mitochondrial function, which are key events (KEs) in some AOPs. Specifically, it could be linked to:

- AOP 3: Inhibition of mitochondrial complex I leading to parkinsonian motor deficits, as the assay is sensitive to mitochondrial toxicants affecting dopaminergic neurons (Source: AOPwiki, status not specified).
- AOP 48: Binding of agonists to ionotropic glutamate receptors causing excitotoxicity and neuronal cell death, which relates to neuronal network impairment.
- AOP 13: Chronic NMDAR antagonism impairing learning and memory, as the assay assesses neuronal network development and integrity.
- AOP 42: Inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis affecting neurodevelopment, as the assay models neurodevelopmental processes.

The assay can cover an AOP MIE/KE by testing for disturbances in neurite outgrowth, mitochondrial function, and cell viability, which are relevant KE(s) in these AOPs. It is particularly suited to detect mitochondrial toxicants and neurodevelopmental impairments, thus serving as an in vitro KE assay within these AOP frameworks.
