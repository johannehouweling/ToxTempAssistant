Please describe in no more than 200 words the following:,"This in vitro test method is based on human neurons (LUHMES cells) at a stage of neurite growth. It assesses disturbances in (a) the mitochondrial respiration in general, and (b) individual mitochondrial parameters, by exposure to toxicants. The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) are measured simultaneously using a Seahorse XF Analyzer. Basal respiration, acute response to test compound, ATP production-coupled respiration, proton leak, maximal respiration, respiratory spare capacity and non-mitochondrial respiration are determined. The data of this method are meant to predict functional impairment of mitochondria. The method has not undergone formal validation and has not been part of a ring trial. It predicts some aspects of neurotoxicity, but not all aspects covered by an in vivo neurotoxicity study (TG424).",High,"The answer provides a comprehensive description of the in vitro test method, including the cell type used, the parameters measured, the equipment used, and the purpose of the method. It also mentions the limitations regarding validation and comparison to in vivo studies. This level of detail fully addresses the question within the word limit.","The MitoStressLUHMES assay (MSL) is an in vitro method that uses human dopaminergic LUHMES neurons to assess mitochondrial respiration impairment. LUHMES cells, originally derived from an 8‐week human fetal mesencephalon, are first maintained in proliferation medium and then induced to differentiate into neurons using tetracycline, GDNF, and db‐cAMP. On day 3 of differentiation, the cells are reseeded on coated Agilent Seahorse XFe24-well plates and switched to Seahorse assay medium prior to exposure. During the assay, the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) are recorded concurrently using a Seahorse XF Analyzer. Specific mitochondrial parameters are derived by sequentially injecting the test compound, oligomycin, FCCP, and a rotenone/antimycin A mix to measure basal respiration, acute response, ATP production, proton leak, maximal respiration, respiratory spare capacity, and non-mitochondrial respiration. The method offers mechanistic information on mitochondrial function as a potential key event in neurotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity but has not yet undergone formal validation or ring trials.

"Which biological process(es) (e.g. neurite outgrowth, differentiation) and/or toxicological events (e.g. oxidative stress, cell death) are modelled/reflected by your test method? (8.1)",,Low,No answer provided; treated as missing.,"The MSL test method is designed to model mitochondrial function in human dopaminergic neurons. It evaluates toxicological events related to compound‐induced impairment of mitochondrial respiration. In particular, it measures endpoints such as the acute change in oxygen consumption rate, basal respiration, ATP production–coupled respiration, proton leak, maximal respiration, respiratory spare capacity, and non‐mitochondrial respiration. Although the assay is performed using LUHMES cells already committed to a neuronal (dopaminergic) phenotype, its primary focus is on mitochondrial bioenergetics rather than on processes like neurite outgrowth. In doing so, the method reflects early toxic events (e.g. mitochondrial dysfunction that may lead to cell death) that are relevant for understanding neurotoxicity during neuronal differentiation and maturation.

"Describe the acceptance criteria (AC) for your initial cells (i.e. the quality criteria for your proliferating cell line, tissue for isolation, organism, etc.). Which specifications do you consider to describe the material, which quality control criteria have to be fulfilled (e.g. pathogen-free)?

However, it lacks clarity and completeness in several areas: it does not specify quantitative definitions for acceptance criteria, does not address pluripotency control for iPSCs, stability over passages, or exclusion criteria. Additionally, it does not cover special requirements for genetically-modified cells or microphysiological systems.","The initial proliferating LUHMES cells must meet clearly defined quality criteria. For example, the working stock cells must be pathogen‐free (with routine mycoplasma testing performed after thawing) and are initially checked for marker gene expression when the stock is created. Once in use, each thawed batch undergoes visual inspection—cells should display an oval morphology without excessive aggregation or clustering, and the culture medium must appear normal (i.e. not yellow). In addition, about 5–10% cell death (i.e. some dead cells floating) is considered acceptable, but a marked increase in cell death upon passaging (typically after thawing) is a cause for batch discard. Only proliferating cells from working stocks up to passage 18 are used. No quantitative functional parameters (e.g. responses to reference compounds) are required at this stage; rather, the focus is on structural integrity and viability before any compound exposure.

However, it lacks detail on critical consumables, batch effects, handling steps, and specific recommendations for genetically-modified cells and microphysiological systems. The response could be more comprehensive and detailed to fully address the question.","The documents indicate that variability in the source cell population can arise from several factors. For example, differences in the cells’ passage number and the inherent variability between cell batches (e.g. ATCC‐provided cells versus cells from the working stock) can alter their behavior (Sources: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf, Sections 3.5 and 4.4). In terms of critical consumables and batch effects, variability may be introduced by the plastic ware and coating reagents; note that the plates and flasks must be coated consistently with poly‑L‑ornithine and fibronectin, and differences in suppliers or new lots of these materials can cause uneven cell distribution and clumping. Although fetal calf serum is not explicitly mentioned in these protocols, when serum or serum replacements are used in similar systems, batch effects can occur. Likewise, critical additives such as the type of trypsin (or alternatives) can have an impact on cell detachment and survival.

Regarding handling steps and influencing factors, special care is necessary when seeding and washing the cells. Small deviations in cell density can have a severe impact—both too low and too high confluency (ideally maintained between 40% and 90%) can alter the metabolic behavior. Pipetting must be performed carefully (e.g. using a multistepper pipette), and steps such as medium changes should be done quickly and uniformly to minimize time at room temperature. In addition, washing procedures (for instance, ensuring that the coated plastic ware is washed properly to remove excess coating solution) and avoiding over-aspiration are critical to maintain reproducibility.

For genetically modified cells and systems incorporating microphysiological aspects, additional factors come into play. In these cases the cells’ response might depend on matrix chemistry and geometry, such as the quality and consistency of the coating material or the design of the microfluidics. Attention should also be paid to differences between cells located at the surface versus the core of a three-dimensional structure.

To increase reproducibility and performance, it is recommended that:
• The passage number is strictly controlled (e.g. cells from the working stock should be used only up to passage 18).
• Consistent and validated batches of plastic ware and coating reagents are sourced from the same supplier.
• Cell density is carefully standardized during seeding, and any seeding errors are promptly documented and corrected.
• Critical handling steps such as medium replacement, brief incubation out of the incubator, and careful pipetting are performed using standardized procedures.
• For microphysiological systems or genetically modified cells, additional validation of matrix properties (chemistry/geometry) is performed to ensure consistent cell behavior.

These recommendations help to mitigate batch effects and handling variability that might otherwise compromise assay reproducibility. (Sources: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf, Sections 3.5 and 4.4)",0.718726664175136,0.21884198486804962,-0.11318214982748032,0.03225095197558403

However, it lacks a graphical overview and does not fully address special/additional requirements for microphysiological systems and organoids, such as cell printing, self-aggregation, interaction with the matrix, and geometrical characterization.","The protocol starts with proliferating LUHMES cells that are “primed” for neuronal differentiation in a two‐step process. A simplified scheme is as follows (see Figure 1 in the document for the graphical overview):

1. • Day –1: Cells are seeded in proliferation medium (Advanced DMEM/F12 plus supplements such as N2 and FGF).  
  – This initial step ensures a high viability and even distribution for subsequent differentiation.

2. • Day 0: The proliferation medium is completely removed and replaced by differentiation medium.  
  – Differentiation medium contains tetracycline (1 µg/ml) to shut down v-myc expression, along with db-cAMP (1 mM) and GDNF (2 ng/ml), which drive the cells toward a dopaminergic phenotype.

3. • Day 2: As the differentiation proceeds and cells have extended neurites (typically reaching a stage where neurites are about as long as the cell body), the cells are trypsinized and re-plated onto pre-coated Agilent Seahorse XFe24-well plates (coated with poly-L-ornithine and fibronectin).  
  – At this point, the medium is replaced with differentiation medium without cAMP and GDNF to allow for adherence and stabilization.
  – The re-plating step is critical to obtain an even monolayer on the assay plate.

4. • Day 3: About one hour after re-plating, the medium is changed to Seahorse assay medium (a modified DMEM/F12 supplemented with pyruvate, glucose or galactose, glutamine, and a low level of tetracycline) prior to the oxygen consumption measurements (OCR).  
  – During the assay, test compounds and tool compounds are injected in a defined sequence while OCR is recorded.

For all steps, meticulous manipulation is necessary (e.g. minimal time at room temperature and precise pipetting using multichannel pipettes) and the coating of plasticware is performed with poly-L-ornithine and fibronectin overnight to guarantee proper cell attachment and distribution.

Note that while the current protocol establishes a clear differentiation pathway using medium changes and re-plating for 2D cultures, additional procedures required for microphysiological systems or organoids—such as cell printing, self-aggregation processes, interaction with a 3D matrix, or geometric characterization—are not incorporated here. LUHMES cells under this protocol are grown as a 2D monolayer, although literature is available that explores 3D growth under different conditions (see sections 3.2–3.7 of the document).

2. The purity and identity of the cell population are ensured through propagation from a masterstock that was originally derived from a human mesencephalic cell line. Although specific percentages (e.g. 95% Oct4-positive for iPSC) are not detailed for LUHMES cells, the cells are regularly inspected visually for correct (oval) morphology, low levels of spontaneous cell death (approximately 5–10% tolerated), and the absence of clustering or aggregates.

These omissions prevent a 'High' score.","The test system used in the assay is based on human LUHMES cells that are cultured as a 2D monolayer without any collagen embedding or formation of three‐dimensional microtissues. In the MitoStressLUHMES assay (MSL), the general culture protocol involves an initial seeding of proliferative LUHMES cells in proliferation medium (day –1). On day 0 the medium is replaced by differentiation medium containing tetracycline (to shut down v-myc expression), GDNF, and dibutyryl cAMP to induce neuronal differentiation.

However, it lacks detail on the analytical methods used to evaluate these criteria, specific values for acceptance, and historical control data. The criteria are also not quantified, which limits the completeness of the response.","The MSL assay‐protocol uses a combination of simple morphological and visual acceptance criteria to ensure that the LUHMES test system is “fit‐for‐purpose” before starting compound exposure. For example, before the assay on day 3 the test system is evaluated as follows (see sections 4.1–4.3 in the document):

• Neuronal morphology and differentiation: When the cells are trypsinized on day 2 prior to re‐plating, they need to show neurites that are roughly as long as the cell body. This indicates that the cells have initiated proper differentiation.

• Cell distribution and adherence: On day 3 the cells must be evenly distributed (i.e. no clumping or aggregation) and they must remain adherent after the medium change. In addition, a confluency of about 80% is expected.

• Contamination and cell health: Visual inspection is used to confirm that cells are not contaminated and that the appearance is healthy with low (<10%) cell death (a few floating dead cells are acceptable). Additional metrics such as nuclear counting via Hoechst H‑33342 staining are performed using a high-content microscope (Cellomics Array Scan) to verify total cell counts.

Although additional quality‐control endpoints may be determined during the cell source and differentiation phase (for example, expression of markers like bIII‐tubulin or Fox-3/NeuN analyzed by immunostaining or RT‑qPCR), routine acceptance before toxicity testing is based on morphology, confluency, and adherence.

Historically, when these criteria are applied over consecutive differentiations (e.g. 10 independent experiments), the cultures consistently show on average the required 80% confluency; neurite lengths that approximate cell body dimensions; and minimal cell death or loss of adhesion. If any of these acceptance criteria are not met (for instance, if the cells show significantly lower confluency, unexpected clustering, extensive cell death, or detachment after medium change), the batch is rejected and the experiment either is repeated with a new cell batch or appropriate troubleshooting measures (e.g. reviewing plastic coating procedures and cell density calculations) are implemented.

However, it lacks specific quantitative values for these criteria and does not provide historical control data or actions if criteria are not met. The response is incomplete and lacks clarity on endpoints and parameters like degree of differentiation or cell density.","The assay’s acceptance criteria focus on ensuring that the LUHMES cells display the expected morphology, distribution, and functional parameters before and after compound exposure. For example, in the MitoStressLUHMES assay:

• At the start of the test system (prior to re‐plating and assay), cells must be healthy and show signs of early differentiation. This involves having neurites that are roughly as long as the cell body, a fairly even distribution in the well, and a confluency of about 80%. Furthermore, cells should be pathogen‐free, show only minimal cell death (approximately 5–10% is normal), and remain adherent. (Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf, sections 4.2 and 3.4)

• At the end of compound exposure (after treatment), the negative controls must display a stable functional profile. Specifically, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) should not fluctuate significantly in response to the control injection. In addition, tool compound injection must yield the characteristic MitoStress Test profile. Moreover, all wells should show healthy nuclear morphology, the cells must remain adherent, and measured oxygen levels should start at approximately 150 mmHg and never fall below 60 mmHg. (Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf, section 4.3)

In routine practice, historical controls (e.g. from ten or more differentiation runs) are used to monitor these parameters. Although exact quantitative historical values (such as an average neurite length with a standard deviation) are not defined in the document, the laboratory’s experience ensures that if, for example, at re‑plating the neurites are considerably shorter than expected or if the OCR changes in the negative controls are outside the acceptable range, the entire experiment is discarded. In other words, experiments with a markedly reduced differentiation (e.g. negative control OCR values that deviate from the typical baseline or tool compound injections that fail to produce the characteristic profile) are not used for further analysis. (Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf)

Thus, the quality criteria encompass morphological endpoints (neurite length, cell shape, even distribution, confluency), viability (low spontaneous cell death, healthy nuclei, proper adherence), and functional endpoints (stable OCR with proper oxygen levels and the expected MitoStress profile). If these criteria are not met—such as if differentiation is insufficient (e.g. neurite length is largely below that of the cell body) or if functional readouts in the controls fall outside the expected range—the experiment is discarded and not used for further toxicological evaluation.

The answer could be improved by including these missing elements and providing more detailed guidance on handling and control measures.","Below is a summary of the main factors known to affect the final state of the assay test system, along with recommended measures to improve reproducibility:

1. Causes of variability and critical consumables/batch effects:  
 • Coating quality of plates/flasks is critical. Variability may arise with differences in the PLO/fibronectin batches, water quality used for coating, and different plastic lots or suppliers.  
 • Medium and supplement batch effects (e.g. differences in FGF or other additives) can influence cell behavior. Although no serum (FCS) is reported per se, any serum replacement or additive lot variation will also be critical.  
 • Cell batch and cell passage effects are important. Cells from different working stock vials or at higher passage numbers may show altered morphology and metabolic behavior.  
  (Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf, sections 3.5 and 4.4)

2. Critical handling steps and influencing factors:  
 • Critical pipetting steps are noted: seeding errors and medium changes in particular must be performed quickly – for instance, on day 3, only two wells should be aspirated and refilled at once to minimize time at room temperature.  
 • Maintaining the proper cell density is key (final confluency ~80%, never exceeding 90% nor falling below 40% during culture) to ensure even cell distribution and consistent metabolic status.  
 • Plate handling, including rapid switching from growth to assay medium and avoiding prolonged exposure of cells at room temperature, is essential.  
  (Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf, sections 4.4 and 6. Handling details)

3. Controls and their expected outcomes:  
 • Negative control: Injection of 0.1% DMSO should not significantly alter the oxygen consumption rate (OCR). For valid experiments, the OCR in negative controls should remain stable (starting approx. 150 mmHg and not dropping below 60 mmHg).  
 • Positive (mechanistic) controls: Tool compounds (the sequential injection of oligomycin, FCCP, then rotenone plus antimycin A) are expected to yield the characteristic MitoStress Test profile. For example, oligomycin should result in a decrease in ATP-linked respiration and subsequent injections should reveal maximal and non-mitochondrial respiration, with deviations confined within preset technical and biological variation.  
  Exact allowable deviations are not numerically defined but are determined based on historical variability (e.g. variation within roughly 2×SD of the baseline).  
  (Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf, sections 4.3 and 5.7)

4. Recommendations to increase reproducibility and performance:  
 • Use the same, pre-tested batches of critical consumables (coating reagents, medium additives, plastic ware) and document their lot numbers.  
 • Maintain strict adherence to the seeding and handling protocols (timing of medium change, rapid pipetting during well-to-well transfers, and minimizing time exposed to room temperature).  
 • Use cells from a well-controlled working stock (preferably with passages kept below the recommended limit) to minimize batch-to-batch variability.  
 • Implement internal controls on each plate and monitor negative control profiles (stable OCR, healthy cell morphology, and adherence) to quickly identify technical outliers.  
 • Training of the operators in multistep pipetting and assay handling (with an emphasis on reproducibility) is essential.

It lacks a direct comparison or discussion of differences and gaps.,"The test system uses human LUHMES‐derived dopaminergic neurons that reproduce several key features of central nervous system tissue (for example, expression of the dopamine transporter and the growth of axons/neurites), but there remain several gaps to consider in terms of full in vivo analogy. For instance, the cells are used at an early post‑mitotic stage (day 3 of differentiation in the MSL assay), so compared to mature human brain tissue they lack aspects of full synaptic connectivity and the complete network organization found in vivo. Moreover, the in vitro culture is performed in a controlled two‑dimensional environment on coated plastic surfaces—with defined media and absence of supporting elements such as astrocytes (unless specifically co‑cultured) or other cell types—that may influence cell behavior and metabolism differently from the complex three‑dimensional tissue architecture, extracellular matrix composition, and systemic signals present in a living brain. These differences should be kept in mind when interpreting mitochondrial perturbations observed in the assay, as not all aspects of neurotoxicity (e.g. long‐term network effects, intercellular communication, or full synaptic maturation) are captured in the current system.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Day –1 (Seeding for Proliferation)  
• Proliferating LUHMES cells are seeded in proliferation medium onto standard culture vessels.  
• Cells are maintained in a subconfluent state (generally 40–90% confluency) and cultured on plates pre‐coated with poly‐L-ornithine (PLO) and fibronectin.  

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Day 0 (Initiation of Differentiation)  
• The medium is exchanged from proliferation medium to differentiation medium.  
  – Differentiation medium contains tetracycline (1 µg/ml) which shuts down v-myc, plus GDNF (2 ng/ml) and db-cAMP (1 mM) to drive differentiation.  
• Cells begin to undergo neurite outgrowth.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Day 2 (Re-plating for the Seahorse Assay)  
• Cells reach ~20–30 million per T75 flask. They are then trypsinized and re-plated into Agilent Seahorse XFe24-well plates.  
• Re-plating is done at a density of 100,000 cells per well in 100 µl of differentiation medium that has been modified—specifically lacking cAMP and GDNF.  
• After ~1 hour of attachment, the volume is topped up to 500 µl per well.  
• Simultaneously, the Seahorse cartridge is rehydrated with XF Calibrant and pre-warmed at 37°C without CO₂.
  
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Day 3 (Assay Day – Exposure and Measurement)  
• Approximately 1 hour before the assay starts, the medium is changed from differentiation medium to Seahorse assay medium.  
  – Seahorse assay medium is based on XF DMEM (pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mM pyruvate, 18 mM glucose (or galactose for increased sensitivity), 2 mM glutamine, and 2.25 µM tetracycline.  
• At this point, no re-addition of differentiation supplements is performed; the focus is on the assay readout.  
• The assay procedure is initiated:
  – The Seahorse XF Analyzer begins measuring the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR).  
  – Test compounds are injected via the cartridge (first the test compound followed sequentially by tool compounds: oligomycin, FCCP, and rotenone/antimycin A) to determine various mitochondrial parameters.  
  – Further, Hoechst H-33342 is injected with the last injection to stain the nuclei for cell count normalization (imaged post assay using high-content microscopy).  

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Additional Notes  
• The overall assay uses freshly re-plated cells that have already started neurite formation (criteria include approximately neurite lengths similar to the cell body) and a healthy, uniform distribution on the coated Seahorse plates.  
• The coating of plates is critical to avoid aggregation; PLO and fibronectin are applied overnight and the vessels are washed with MilliQ water before use.  
• Critical medium supplements (tetracycline, GDNF, and db-cAMP) appear during the differentiation stage but are deliberately excluded (cAMP and GDNF) in the medium used on day 2 during re-plating to adapt the cells for the Seahorse assay.  
• No test compounds are re-added if a medium change occurs on assay day; compounds are added only via the dedicated injection ports of the Seahorse cartridge.

This graphical timeline integrates the cell culture steps (seeding, medium changes, re-plating on coated plates) with the assay-specific steps (medium change to Seahorse assay medium, sequential compound injections, and final imaging for cell count), thus outlining the exposure scheme in the context of the overall cell culture protocol _(Sources: EFSA NAMs Case Study on Tebufenpyrad, Part 2 – Annex A)_",0.7865939462625993,0.21090586483478546,-0.102105513215065,0.036560967564582825

However, it does not specify whether cytotoxicity is the primary endpoint, nor does it clearly identify secondary endpoints or reference/normalization endpoints. The answer lacks clarity and completeness in addressing all aspects of the question.","The MSL assay is designed primarily to assess mitochondrial function by quantifying several specific mitochondrial respiration parameters rather than using cytotoxicity as the primary endpoint. In our protocol the primary endpoints consist of:

 • Acute response to the test compound (i.e. the immediate change in OCR when the test substance is added)  
 • Basal respiration  
 • ATP production-coupled respiration  
 • Proton leak  
 • Maximal respiration  
 • Respiratory spare capacity  
 • Non‐mitochondrial respiration

In addition, a key secondary endpoint is the total cell count per well, which is derived from staining nuclei with Hoechst H‐33342 and subsequent imaging. This measurement serves two roles: it provides a normalization reference for all OCR (and ECAR) values and serves as an indicator of general cellular/cytotoxic effects. In our assay, cytotoxicity is not the primary endpoint but is monitored via the total cell count and the visual evaluation of cell morphology (e.g. healthy nuclear appearance and cell adherence) so that decreases in respiration can be distinguished from non‐specific loss of cells.

Thus, while the focus remains on the measurement of mitochondrial respiratory parameters as the primary readouts, the cell count (and, by extension, cell health parameters) act as reference/normalization endpoints to correct for variations in cell number and to help flag overt cytotoxicity.

However, it lacks a general overview of the method's key steps and does not address whether multiple endpoints are measured in the same well or independently. Additionally, it does not explain the quantification algorithm or how semi-quantitative estimates are obtained, which are crucial for a complete understanding of the method.","The MSL assay is a live-cell metabolic assay that primarily measures mitochondrial respiration using a Seahorse XF Analyzer. In brief, LUHMES cells are differentiated into dopaminergic neurons and then re‑plated in specialized Seahorse plates. On the day of the assay, the cells are maintained alive (i.e. not fixed) in Seahorse assay medium. After an initial baseline measurement of oxygen consumption rate (OCR), a series of injections (test compound, tool compounds such as oligomycin, FCCP, rotenone/antimycin A) are administered sequentially to perturb mitochondrial function and thereby allow calculation of key parameters such as basal respiration, ATP production‑dependent respiration, proton leak, maximal respiration, spare capacity, and non‑mitochondrial respiration _(Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf, sections 5.1–5.3)_.

In parallel, at the end of the metabolic measurements, cells are exposed to the nuclear dye Hoechst H‑33342. This staining is performed without prior fixation because the metabolic measurements are obtained in live, intact cells. The stained nuclei are then imaged using a Cellomics Array Scan device where the quantification algorithm identifies nuclei based on predetermined criteria (size, area, shape, and intensity). Roughly 25 image fields per well are captured to yield a robust cell count that is subsequently used to normalize all OCR endpoints _(Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf, sections 5.1 and 5.3)_.

Thus, both the metabolic endpoints and the cell count are produced from the same well and under the same conditions. The live-cell approach enables measurement of physiological respiration in real time, while subsequent high‑content imaging provides the necessary normalization via cell counting without the need for additional separate processing steps such as fixation or homogenization.

In summary, the assay’s key steps are:  
1. Differentiation of LUHMES cells and re‑plating onto coated Seahorse plates.  
2. Live measurement of OCR via sequential addition of specific mitochondrial effectors, allowing calculation of several mitochondrial respiration parameters.  
3. Post-assay nuclear staining with Hoechst followed by high‑content imaging to count cells and thus normalize the metabolic data.  

This integrated approach—measuring multiple endpoints (metabolic parameters and cell count) in the same well—ensures that the metabolic readouts are reliably adjusted for potential differences in cell number.",0.7259441940395941,0.14084507524967194,0.043042056262493134,0.09355828911066055
"Provide information on machine settings, analytical standards, data processing and normalization procedures. For imaging endpoints: provide detailed algorithm. This information should also be covered in an SOP, preferably in DB-ALM format (see link in 6.6).",,Low,No answer provided; treated as missing.,"Below is a summary of the information provided in the documents regarding machine settings, analytical standards, data processing/normalization, and—in the case of imaging endpoints—a detailed description of the image analysis algorithm. Note that much of this information is also contained in the lab‐internal SOP (in DB-ALM format, see section 6.6) that can be requested from the Leist‐lab.

Machine Settings and Analytical Standards  
• For the Seahorse XF Analyzer the following settings and procedures are used:  
 – The instrument is calibrated using XF Calibrant and the cartridge is rehydrated at 37°C without CO₂ immediately prior to the assay (see “4.1 Principles of the culture protocol” and “6.1 Preparation / addition of test compounds”).  
 – Injection port programming is set so that the test compound and tool compounds (e.g. 1 µM oligomycin, 1.5 µM FCCP, 0.5 µM rotenone plus 0.5 µM antimycin A, and 1 µg/ml H-33342) are delivered at precise time points.  
 – The oxygen levels are monitored and must begin at about 150 mmHg and never drop below 60 mmHg during the measurements (“4.3 Acceptance criteria for the test system at the end of compound exposure”).  

• For imaging endpoints, the Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS high content reader is used with the following machine parameters:  
 – Images are acquired in channel 1 (UV-Hoechst) with exposure times set manually.  
 – Typical image resolution is 512×512 pixels (in 8- or 16-bit format).  
 – The instrument is maintained in routine operation as per the manufacturer’s specifications and stored protocols.

Data Processing and Normalization Procedures  
• Raw metabolic data from the Seahorse XF Analyzer are stored in Wave Assay Result files (.asyr), which include both the metabolic readouts (OCR, ECAR) and metadata (“7.1 Raw data format”).  
• Prior to further analysis the OCR values are normalized to the total cell count per well. The cell counts are captured via the imaging endpoint, as detailed below.  
• Data processing is performed by:  
 – Exporting raw OCR data to Seahorse Analytics and/or Microsoft Excel, where artefacts and outliers (defined by technical issues such as focusing errors) are removed.  
 – Normalized OCR values are calculated using the first overall measurement and the first measurement after each injection for endpoints such as basal respiration, ATP production–coupled respiration, proton leak, and spare capacity (“5.3 Overview of analytical method(s) to assess test endpoint(s)”).  
 – Further statistical treatment (curve fitting, concentration–response analyses) is performed in Excel and GraphPad Prism using a least squares 4-parameter log fit, with quality control including outlier detection based on both biological and technical criteria (“7.4 Curve fitting”).

Detailed Algorithm for Imaging Endpoints  
• Cells are stained with Hoechst H-33342, which is injected with the final tool compound and incubated (25 minutes during OCR measurements and 20 additional minutes post-experiment).  
• The imaging workflow is as follows:  
 1. The Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS reader acquires images in a predetermined number of fields per well (usually 25 fields) at a resolution of 512×512 pixels.  
 2. Advanced segmentation algorithms within the Array Scan software are used to identify cell nuclei. This algorithm applies predetermined thresholds for:  
  – Object size and area: Only objects within a defined size range are accepted.  
  – Shape criteria: Roundness and other shape features are used to discriminate nuclei from artefacts.  
  – Intensity threshold: Only objects with fluorescence intensities matching Hoechst staining are counted.  
 3. Once nuclei are identified based on these parameters, the total cell count per well is calculated by scaling up the count from the 25 imaged fields based on the well area.  
 4. The resultant cell count is then used as the denominator to normalize the OCR values from the Seahorse analyzer.  
 5. Image quality and focusing issues are documented (for example, if fewer channels or fields are recorded, these data points are flagged and may be excluded).  

All the above data processing and normalization steps—including imaging analysis—are detailed in the lab-internal SOP (provided in DB-ALM format, as referenced in section 6.6). This SOP gives further step-by-step instructions and includes quality control measures and troubleshooting guidelines.

 • Expected Data: Minimal change in OCR, serving as baseline for comparing MCC responses.  
 • Role in AC: Validates that observed changes are compound-specific rather than due to the solvent.

Correlation of Pathway Inhibition/Activation with Test Response  
– In both assay types (MSL and MCL), pathway inhibitions (e.g. by rotenone, malonate, antimycin A, sodium azide) consistently lead to predictable decreases in OCR or complex activity.  
– Activation via FCCP results in an increased OCR.  
Thus, the changes induced by these MCCs (increases or decreases in OCR) correlate directly with the expected response of the test method; they validate that the underlying mitochondrial pathways are being modulated as anticipated.  

The highlighted compounds for setting acceptance criteria (AC) on a day‐to‐day basis are oligomycin, FCCP, and the rotenone/antimycin A combination (for the MSL assay) along with the specific inhibitors (rotenone for cI, malonate for cII, antimycin A for cIII, and sodium azide for cIV) in the MCL assay.

What chemicals/manipulations are used as positive controls? Describe the expected data on such controls (signal and its uncertainty)? How good are in vivo reference data on the positive controls? Are in vivo relevant threshold concentrations known?,,Low,No answer provided; treated as missing.,"The documents do not list a dedicated “positive control” condition (i.e. a separate chemical or manipulation used solely for positive control) but they do detail a series of sequential injections of known modulators of mitochondrial respiration. For example, the assay protocol calls for injections of 1 µM oligomycin, 1.5 µM FCCP, and a mixture of 0.5 µM rotenone plus 0.5 µM antimycin A. These compounds are used to generate a defined mitochondrial stress‐profile. In other words, when injected in a working assay the expected responses are a rapid decrease in oxygen consumption (reflecting ATP production–coupled respiration or baseline inhibition with oligomycin), a peak in OCR (maximal respiration following FCCP), and a drop to a minimal OCR value (following rotenone/antimycin A) that defines non‐mitochondrial respiration. The data variability (uncertainty) is not quantitatively described in the documents, other than by stating that “tool compound injection should yield the characteristic MitoStress Test profile” and that certain acceptance criteria are based on visual inspection. 

Regarding in vivo reference data, the documents indicate that no formal validation (e.g. ring trials) has been performed and no in vivo thresholds or relevant concentration ranges are provided. In other words, there is no detailed or well‐established set of in vivo reference data or threshold concentrations for these positive control compounds in the context of this assay.

It lacks details on expected data, rationale for concentration setting, and information on unspecific controls, making it incomplete.","Both the MSL and MCL assays use the cell culture solvent (0.1% DMSO) as the negative control. In wells receiving only 0.1% DMSO no compound is added, so the OCR signal remains at its baseline, with no significant change upon “injection” (i.e. no active compound response). In practice, the negative control wells are expected to show a stable oxygen consumption rate starting at around 150 mmHg (and never dropping below 60 mmHg) with only the small variability inherent to technical replicates being observed. This background “noise” is defined by the baseline fluctuation of the OCR measurements and by outlier‐exclusion routines applied during data processing. The 0.1% final DMSO concentration is chosen because it is the vehicle used to prepare all test compound solutions; it is low enough that it does not influence cell viability, mitochondrial function, or alter the test readout yet identical conditions are maintained across all wells.

In addition, the MCL assay employs an unspecific control: MG132 is used at a final concentration of 100 nM. The rationale for including MG132 is to help identify effects that might not be mediated specifically by mitochondrial complex inhibition but rather reflect unspecific perturbations. The 100 nM level is selected as it is recognized to be below cytotoxic levels while serving as a benchmark for unspecific assay interference.

In both the MitoStressLUHMES (MSL) and the MitoComplexesLUHMES (MCL) protocols, there is only a general note that the LUHMES cells are “highly sensitive to toxicants” and that cell death is easily quantified (for example, by counting nuclei after Hoechst staining and by noting that LDH release shows high baseline activity) (Source: MSL, section 5.8; MCL, section 5.8). There is no discussion of a specific apoptotic sensitivity or resistance phenotype, nor is there any detailed description of challenges in capturing cytotoxicity for minor cellular subpopulations. Likewise, because the test system consists of a rather homogeneous population of LUHMES (either differentiated neurons or proliferating precursors) no subpopulation is singled‐out as being particularly sensitive, and no specific markers for distinct subpopulations are provided.

Furthermore, the protocols do not mention whether there are issues with distinguishing slowed proliferation from cell death, nor is there any information on considerations for repeated or prolonged dosing (for example, regarding early death and compensatory growth). In addition, for very short‐term endpoints such as electrophysiological measurements performed 30 minutes after toxicant exposure, no delayed measure of cytotoxicity is provided.

– Cytotoxicity capture in minor subpopulations or the use of distinct markers for such.  
– Differentiation between slowed proliferation and cell death.  
– Considerations of compensatory growth following early death in repeated dosing.

Which rule do you apply to test whether a test run is within the normal performance frame? How do you document this decision? Indicate actions if the AC are not met.,,Low,No answer provided; treated as missing.,"We determine if a test run is “within the normal performance frame” by checking that all the pre‐defined acceptance criteria (AC) outlined in the assay protocol are met. For example, in the MitoStressLUHMES assay the AC include:

• Baseline conditions such as ensuring oxygen levels start at approximately 150 mmHg and never fall below 60 mmHg.  
• Negative controls must show no significant changes in OCR following control injections, and the tool compound must produce the characteristic MitoStress Test profile.  
• Visual criteria like healthy nuclei morphology, proper cell adherence before and after medium change, and an even cell distribution.

These criteria (see sections 4.3 “Acceptance criteria for the test system at the end of compound exposure” and 5.1 “Exposure scheme for toxicity testing” in the document) are applied by comparing the experimental readouts and visual checks to these set thresholds.

The decision is documented by:
 – Recording the measured values and observations in the corresponding plate maps, metadata (e.g., saved Seahorse instrument data with annotations), and the lab book.  
 – Noting any deviations from the AC and flagging those runs in the experimental documentation.

If the AC are not met, the protocol requires that the test run be considered invalid. In such cases, corrective actions include troubleshooting possible issues (such as problems with plastic coating, cell density, or instrument settings), flagging or excluding the anomalous data from further analysis, and repeating the experiment to obtain a valid run.

However, it lacks clarity on the possibility or extent of repeated measures from the same dish over time, which is part of the question.","Based on the calculations detailed for the MitoStressLUHMES (MSL) assay, one data point is defined as one concentration condition (i.e. one compound at one concentration) once the technical replicates are combined and all necessary controls (calibration and acceptability criteria) are excluded. In the original throughput section the estimate was given as follows:

• 6 test compounds are measured per plate (each at one concentration) → 6 data points per plate  
• Using 3 plates per day yields 18 data points per day  
• With 3 assay days per week the weekly total is 18 × 3 = 54 data points per week  
• Originally, 4 weeks would result in 216 data points per month; however, here we are assuming only 3 working weeks per month, which means 54 × 3 = 162 real data points per month  

Regarding repeated measures from the same dish, although the Seahorse XF Analyzer records multiple time‐point measurements (for example, before and after compound and tool injections) this temporal information is used to calculate specific endpoints (like basal respiration, ATP production, etc.) and is subsequently averaged (or normalized) to yield a single value per condition. That is, while the assay does obtain repeated measurements on the same dish, these are not counted as extra independent data points; rather, they serve to reduce technical variability and improve robustness of the single “data point” for the tested concentration.

However, it lacks comprehensive information on the range of volumes, specific lab ware/instruments, temperature/lighting considerations, media/buffers for dilution, decision rules for the solvent, tests of solubility, and details on filtering for sterility. The answer is partially complete and lacks clarity in addressing all aspects of the question.","Both the MSL and the MCL protocols employ very defined compound‐handling procedures; below is an overview based explicitly on the provided EFSA document (Sources: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf):

1. Compound storage and stock preparation  
 • Compounds (delivered as solid/powder) are first dissolved in 100% DMSO. The solution is prepared at a high concentration so that when it is later diluted it gives the desired final test concentration.  
 • The resulting stock solutions are aliquoted in single–experiment volumes (to avoid repeated freeze–thaw cycles) and stored according to the manufacturer’s instructions; in the case of the DMSO used, it is kept in a lightproof, air–tight bottle at room temperature.  
 • Although no explicit filtration step is mentioned, the focus is on avoiding compound degradation by minimizing repeated thawing (Sections 6.1 in both the MSL text and corresponding MCL details).

2. Dilutions and solvent decisions  
 • Prior to an experiment, one stock aliquot is thawed and then diluted in the respective assay medium. For the MSL assay the dilution is made with Seahorse assay medium, while in the MCL assay the MAS buffer freshly supplemented with ADP and digitonin is used.  
 • The dilution is performed to a 10× final concentration and, in the process, the volume of 1% DMSO in the dose solution is achieved so that after injection the final solvent concentration in the culture is 0.1% DMSO.  
 • Decision rules clearly state that DMSO is the preferred solvent and that the final concentration on the cells must be 0.1% (with compounds tested for solubility both as stock (in 100% DMSO) and during dilution in culture medium); problems with solubility have been flagged as a major uncertainty (Section 6.1, MSL; similar details in MCL).

3. Lab ware, volumes, and dispensing instruments  
 • Dispensing is done using multistepper pipettes to ensure precision.  
 • The volumes in the test are exact: for instance, in the MSL assay, cells are plated initially in 100 µl (then filled to 500 µl after 1 hour) and the compound dilutions (at 10× final concentration) are loaded into the hydrated cartridge ports of the Seahorse XF Analyzer.  
 • The cartridge port dispensing system is an integral part of the instrument (the Seahorse Analyzer) with which the diluted test compounds (and tool compounds such as oligomycin, FCCP, rotenone/antimycin A, or H-33342) are automatically injected at the proper time during the assay. (See Section 6.1 of both the MSL and MCL protocols.)

4. Temperature, lighting, and handling considerations  
 • Temperature: Compound stocks are generally stored at room temperature in DMSO (in a lightproof bottle) as per the manufacturer’s recommendation. During the experiment, especially for the Seahorse assay, the cells and compounds are maintained at 37°C (with the cartridge rehydrated in XF Calibrant at 37°C without CO₂).  
 • Lighting: DMSO stocks are kept in lightproof containers to prevent light-induced degradation.  
 • Media for dilution: In the MSL protocol, the Seahorse assay medium is used (composed of Seahorse XF DMEM medium pH 7.4 plus supplemented pyruvate, glucose or galactose, glutamine, and tetracycline); in the MCL protocol, the compounds are diluted in MAS buffer (adjusted just before the experiment with ADP, digitonin, etc.).

5. Final addition to the test system  
 • The final compound dilution is loaded into the cartridge ports of the Seahorse XF Analyzer. This takes place after the medium change to the assay medium on day 3 (for the MSL assay) or after the medium is exchanged for the MAS buffer (in the MCL assay).  
 • The injection occurs automatically during the assay run (after an initial baseline measurement) – compounds are added directly into the wells containing the adherent cells.  
 • Since the wells are pre-treated (cells are seeded and allowed to attach) and the medium is changed 1 hour before the assay, the compound addition is clearly “after” the medium change. In compartmentalized cultures (e.g. in the Seahorse plate), the injection is performed via the dedicated cartridge ports, ensuring that the test compound reaches the cells in the well at the correct timing and volume.

In summary, compound handling follows a sequence that ensures stability (by aliquoting stocks in 100% DMSO and storing in lightproof conditions), precise dilution (to 10× in the respective assay medium, ensuring a final 0.1% DMSO concentration), and automated, precision injection via the Seahorse cartridge system after the medium change on the assay day. These procedures minimize variability due to solubility issues, handling delays, and pipetting errors.

1. Operators record the daily experimental procedures – including any deviations or errors – manually in a paper lab book. These entries include all practical details such as compound handling, pipetting, and timings.

2. In parallel, plate maps for each experiment are defined before the start of the work. These maps are documented as part of the experiment’s metadata, with the files stored on the work group server and also uploaded to the Agilent online evaluation platform.

The response is incomplete and lacks clarity on several aspects of the question.","The pipetting schedule is set up in advance by defining plate maps and an overall experiment timeline that dictates when cells are seeded and when media exchanges or compound additions occur. Before each experiment, the operator calculates concentrations and compound dilutions and then records the intended plate layout in a plate map that is both part of the experimental metadata (stored on a dedicated work‐group server and on the online evaluation platform) and documented manually in a paper lab book (EFSA NAMs Case Study on Tebufenpyrad, Part 2 – Annex A, §§6.2–6.3).

During the experiment, pipetting is carried out in a strictly defined sequence – typically a left‐to‐right and top‐to‐bottom pattern. This sequential pattern minimizes time at room temperature and ensures that the pipetting order follows the pre-established plate map exactly (EFSA NAMs Case Study on Tebufenpyrad, Part 2 – Annex A, §6.3). Any deviations from the plate map (for example, an extra pipetting in one well) are immediately marked on the plate map and noted in the paper lab book. Seeding errors or problems encountered during pipetting are flagged directly on these maps, with additional details on the error (such as pipetting twice in one well) recorded manually at the time of the event. In this way, intermediate steps and potential uncertainties or mistakes are documented in real time.

It also describes known pitfalls, such as premature injection of compounds. The response is relevant and complete.","Both the MSL and the MCL assays report several classes of problematic compounds and handling “pitfalls” that can affect data quality. For example:

• Compounds with low solubility are problematic. They may require stocks prepared in 100% DMSO (with a careful adjustment to a final concentration of 0.1% DMSO on the cells) to avoid precipitation or instability from repeated freeze–thaw cycles. (Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf, Section 6.1)

• Certain compounds exhibit autofluorescence that can interfere with the detection of the Hoechst H‑33342 cell stain. In such cases the measured fluorescence signal may be confounded by compound fluorescence. (Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf, Section 6.1)

• Other interferences include the potential precipitation of medium components if there are issues with the compound dilutions or if the solvent properties change—although not detailed explicitly, careful compound preparation (e.g. aliquoting to avoid repeated freeze–thaw) is emphasized to maintain compound stability. (Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf, Section 6.1)

Experimental variables that are hard to control include aspects of the imaging process; for instance, focusing failures in the high‐content Cellomics Array Scan reader can generate outlier data. The use of autofluorescent compounds further complicates image-based cell counts and endpoint quantification. (Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf, Section 6.5 & 6.8)

Critical handling steps include:
 – The cell seeding and medium change steps, which have to be performed as rapidly as possible (keeping cells only briefly at room temperature) to minimize variability. For example, on day 3 only two wells should be aspirated and refilled at once. (Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf, Section 6.5 & 6.9)
 – Proper coating of plates and flasks with poly‑L‑ornithine and fibronectin is essential for even cell distribution. Poor coating may lead to cell clumping or uneven adhesion. (Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf, Section 3.5 and 3.6)
 – Proper handling of the cartridge in the Seahorse analyzer is critical; setting it down harshly may lead to premature injection of compounds. (Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf, Section 6.5)

Robustness issues and pitfalls include:
 – High sensitivity of the assay to technical variations. Operator training is critical, as multistep pipetting, rapid plate handling, and precise timing in compound injection are all labor-intensive steps that may lead to increased variance if not performed consistently.

Additionally, it does not mention if the test method has been used for high throughput transcriptomics or deep sequencing as alternative endpoints.","The MSL method is linked to a series of complementary assays within the LUHMES‐based test battery. For example:

• UKN3a (database entry “Protocol no 202 in DB‐ALM”) and UKN3b (“Protocol no 196 in DB‐ALM”) are designed to assess compound‐induced neurite integrity impairment in mature dopaminergic neurons after long‐term exposure. In contrast to MSL—which focuses on acute mitochondrial respiration parameters in early differentiating neurons—these methods investigate longer‐term effects on neurite structure.

• UKN4 (NeuriTox) is a pre‐screening assay that tests for impaired neurite outgrowth. A related variant, UKN4b (MitoMet), applies exposure conditions that increase sensitivity toward mitochondrial toxicants. These assays share the use of LUHMES cells but differ from MSL by using longer exposure durations and evaluating neurite outgrowth rather than mitochondrial respiration.

• MCL (database name “MCL_Neuro_LUH_mito_complexes”) is based on Seahorse measurements performed in proliferating LUHMES cells to dissect the activity of individual mitochondrial complexes (cI–cIV). Unlike MSL, which measures overall respiration changes in differentiating neurons, MCL provides a mechanistic breakdown at the level of individual complexes.

In addition, the test system underlying the MSL method (as well as that of related assays such as UKN4) has been characterized using high throughput transcriptomics. A complete transcriptome dataset covering LUHMES differentiation (day 2–10) is available at the EBI database (accession ID S-TOXR1833), demonstrating that deep sequencing or microarray approaches have indeed been used as alternative endpoints.

Alternatively, generated graphs can be saved as images (png or jpg format)",Medium,"The answer provides a general overview of the data processing steps for two types of data (Cellomics and Seahorse metabolic data), including image analysis, data import, and endpoint calculation. However, it lacks specific details on background correction, normalization steps, and how summary data like EC50 or PoD are derived. The description is somewhat fragmented and does not fully address the question's request for a comprehensive step-by-step process.","The extracted raw data from our Seahorse XF Analyzer (OCR, ECAR, etc.) and from our Cellomics imaging readouts (for total cell count via Hoechst‐stained nuclei) are processed as follows (see sections 7.3 and 7.4 of the MSL document):

1. First, the Seahorse XF Analyzer records the oxygen and pH levels and calculates OCR and ECAR. In parallel, images from the Array Scan are used to count cells by detecting nuclei based on size, shape, and intensity. The cell count data are manually transferred (via copy‐paste into Excel) and later merged with the Seahorse dataset.

2. Next, all OCR values are normalized to the total cell count per well. In practice, the first measurement overall and the first readings after each injection are used as baselines. Background correction is performed by subtracting the OCR obtained from medium and inhibitor controls (e.g. the measurement after Rotenone & Antimycin A) so that the subsequent endpoints (such as acute response to compound, basal respiration, ATP production–linked respiration, proton leak, etc.) are derived as differences between these corrected values.

3. The normalized endpoints then serve as the starting point for concentration–response analyses. Data points for each exposure condition are compared to untreated (solvent control, typically 0.1% DMSO) samples. For example, the acute response is calculated as the difference between the post‐injection OCR and the basal OCR, and similar difference calculations are made for other mitochondrial parameters.

4. Finally, the concentration–response data are fitted using a non‐linear (4‐parameter logistic) regression model with least squares in GraphPad Prism. If a non‐linear fit is not achievable, a linear regression is performed. From these fits, summary metrics such as EC50, benchmark concentrations (BMC, where BMC values with upper and lower confidence intervals may be calculated using the online tool “BMCeasy” at http://invitrotox.uni-konstanz.de/BMCeasy/), ratios, and points‐of‐departure (PoD) are determined. Outlier data points (often the result of technical issues like mis‐focus) are identified by visual inspection and excluded.

These steps—from background correction based on medium and inhibitor controls through normalization to untreated control values, and finally fitting dose response curves—form the complete chain from raw data to summary outputs such as EC50, BMC, PoD, etc., as implemented in our lab.

"How are data normally handled to obtain the overall test result (e.g. concentration response fitting using model X, determination of EC50 by method Y, use of EC50 as final data)? How do you model your concentration response curve (e.g. LL.4 parameter fit) and which software do you use (e.g. GraphPad Prism, R, etc.)? Do you usually calculate an uncertainty measure of your summary data (e.g. a 95% confidence interval for the BMC or a BMCL), and with which software? Can you give uncertainty for non-cytotoxicity or no-effect? How do you handle non-monotonic curve shapes or other curve features that are hard to describe with the usual mathematical fit model?","The data are analyzed with Excel and represented with GraphPad Prism. For the concentration curve, a nonlinear regression fit is calculated. The fitting method is least squares. If a non-linear curve fit is not possible, a linear curve fit is performed. The curve deriving from the fit is a 4-parameter log function. Treated concentrations are analyzed for deviation from control. Sometimes it is analyzed whether the deviation of neurite growth is different from the deviation of viability. This is done by two-way ANOVA + Tukey-Kramer post hoc testing. Statistics applied are one-way ANOVA (and nonparametric) with Dunnett’s post test. BMC values with their upper and lower confidence intervals (BMCU and BMCL) are calculated via the publically available online software: http://invitrotox.uni-konstanz.de/BMCeasy/",Medium,"The answer provides some details on data handling, such as using Excel and GraphPad Prism for analysis and a nonlinear regression fit for concentration curves. It mentions the use of a 4-parameter log function and statistical tests like ANOVA. However, it lacks clarity on how non-monotonic curves are handled and does not explicitly address uncertainty measures for non-cytotoxicity or no-effect. The mention of BMC values and confidence intervals is relevant but not fully detailed.","The summary data are derived from a procedure that starts with raw OCR or other endpoint values being normalized (to pre-injection or control) and then processed using nonlinear regression. In practice, the data are first processed in Excel and then curve‐fitted with GraphPad Prism using a 4‐parameter logistic (LL.4) model via a least squares approach. If a robust nonlinear fit cannot be achieved (for instance, in cases with non-monotonic response shapes), a linear fit is performed instead, or alternative statistical tests (e.g. two‑way ANOVA followed by Tukey‑Kramer post hoc tests) are used to compare deviations from control. 

Furthermore, the uncertainty of the fitted summary data is estimated by calculating benchmark concentration (BMC) values along with their upper and lower confidence limits (BMCU and BMCL) using publicly available online tools (http://invitrotox.uni-konstanz.de/BMCeasy/). For endpoints where no effect is seen or in non-cytotoxic conditions, no meaningful uncertainty interval (e.g. 95% confidence interval) can be derived because there is no quantifiable effect to fit. In those cases, the lack of a quantifiable effect is noted instead of providing a conventional CI.

Additionally, it does not specify what metadata should be stored, only what is currently stored.","Metadata for the assay are documented and stored by using a combination of instrument‐generated log files, data files, and manual recording in lab books.

In parallel, the Seahorse XF Analyzer generates a “Wave Assay Result” file (with a .asyr extension) in which the raw data and its associated metadata (e.g. instrument settings, calibration, and time stamps) are stored together. In addition, experimental details such as plate maps and compound concentrations are documented manually in a paper lab book and cross-checked with Excel files that are generated during data processing. 

Thus, metadata are linked to the raw data by:
• Embedding them in the instrument-generated files (the raw .asyr file from the Seahorse analyzer contains the metadata; similarly, the Cellomics system produces log files that accompany the image data).
• Ensuring a unique, descriptive filename scheme that connects the log files, instrument data, and manual records.
• Manual documentation (in lab books and Excel) that details the experiment design (e.g. plate layout, injection order, compound concentrations) and is linked to the electronic raw data via corresponding file names and dates/time stamps.

Overall, the stored (or should be stored) metadata include:
 – Instrument settings and calibration details (e.g. Seahorse assay parameters, Cellomics scan settings).
 – Protocol details (e.g. kinetic protocol, automation settings) as exported in log-files.
 – Experimental design information such as plate maps, seeding, and compound arrangement.
 – Time stamps and unique identifiers that allow the metadata to be cross-referenced with the raw data files.

By quantifying endpoints such as basal respiration, ATP production‐coupled respiration, proton leak, maximal respiration, respiratory spare capacity, and non‐mitochondrial respiration, the assay models a key biochemical process (mitochondrial energy metabolism) that is essential for neuronal function.

In doing so, the method reflects toxicological events such as mitochondrial impairment and energy depletion, which can precede cell stress and eventual neuronal cell death. Because these cells are central to the dopaminergic system, the assay is linked to adverse outcomes related to neurotoxicity—for example, neurodevelopmental deficits and neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinsonian motor dysfunction.

In summary, by modeling mitochondrial respiration in dopaminergic neurons, the assay provides mechanistic insight into how compound-induced mitochondrial dysfunction could translate into in vivo neurotoxicity and adverse outcomes in humans.

"Provide the statistics of your benchmark response (threshold and variance): (i) For dichotomized data, provide your prediction model. When do you consider the result as toxic or not toxic?

What is the rationale for your threshold? This can be on a mathematical (e.g. 3-fold standard deviation) or a biological basis (e.g. below 80% viability). Is there a toxicological rationale for the threshold settings and definitions of your prediction model? What are the limitations of your prediction model? What is a ‘hit’ if the test is used in screening mode (= hit definition, if different from above)?",,Low,No answer provided; treated as missing.,"For the MCL assay (which is used to assess the activity of individual mitochondrial complexes), our prediction model is based on the variability observed in control (baseline) measurements. In our documentation (Section 8.2 of the Annex in the provided context), we define inhibition of a complex as follows:

(i) For dichotomized data the model is formulated so that a complex is considered inhibited (i.e. “toxic”) when its normalized activity is reduced by more than two times the standard deviation (2×SD) of the baseline (control) variation. In the case of complex I, “uncoupling” is similarly defined as an increase in its activity by more than 2×SD relative to baseline. Hence, for a dichotomy:
 • If the change is > 2×SD (either downward for inhibition or upward for cI uncoupling), the response is classified as “toxic.”
 • If the change is within ±2×SD, it is considered non-toxic.

(ii) For pseudo‑dichotomized outcomes – where one might include a borderline class – the “borderline” range is defined as values falling within ±2×SD of the control mean. Responses that fall clearly outside (i.e. < control – 2×SD or > control + 2×SD for cI uncoupling) are classified as toxic, while those within this envelope are viewed as borderline.

(iii) For multi‑class or continuous outcomes the assay endpoints are expressed as percent changes relative to the control value. This permits a grouping (or ranking) of responses. For instance, one could distinguish “no effect” (within ±2×SD), “mild effect” (between 2×SD and a predefined higher fold‐change, for example a threefold change in deviation) and “marked effect” (exceeding that higher threshold). In our application the rationale for using a threshold based on 2×SD is primarily mathematical—to account for inherent assay variability under the same conditions. Alternatively, in assays aimed at measuring cell viability an 80% viability cutoff might be used, reflecting biological rationale, but for our mitochondrial complex activity measurements the statistical baseline is more appropriate. 

Toxicological rationale and limitations:
• The toxicological rationale is that a consistent deviation from the control that exceeds the natural fluctuation (2×SD) is unlikely to be due to random variability. This offers a statistical basis for detecting a true compound‐induced effect.
• However, one limitation is that the threshold is dependent on the quality and consistency of control data. If the baseline variability is high, the 2×SD threshold may be less sensitive. In addition, a statistically significant change does not always directly translate into a biologically adverse outcome.
• In a screening setting (hit definition), a “hit” is defined as a compound that causes at least one of the individual mitochondrial complex activities to change beyond this threshold (i.e. >2×SD deviation compared to control). This hit‐call might be refined in follow‑up testing using more detailed dose–response assessments.

If the PM is two-sided, do different rules, characteristics and interpretations apply to the two sides (e.g. is a decrease in viability or an increase in viability both interpreted as an effect/toxicity; are thresholds and performance characteristics to both sides the same?).",,Low,No answer provided; treated as missing.,"The documents provide only very limited information on the prediction model setup. In the MitoComplexesLUHMES (MCL) assay document it is stated that the prediction model is based on defining a complex as inhibited when its normalized activity is decreased by more than two times the standard deviation of baseline variation. In the special case of complex I, an increase above this threshold (i.e. uncoupling) is also noted. Beyond this threshold‐based criterion, no details are given regarding the test set of chemicals used to “train” the model (no list of chemicals or details on training vs. test sets are provided beyond the note that to date 32 unique compounds have been “tested successfully” in the assay), nor are any details given regarding the use of classifiers or the statistical approaches (e.g. type of regression or machine‐learning methods) to set up the model. The prediction model is documented by reference to Delp et al. (2019), but no further training process or chemical list (or count if n > 50) is provided. 

Regarding whether the prediction model applies to changes on both sides relative to controls, the model is essentially two‐sided for complex I because it flags both a decrease (inhibition) and an increase (uncoupling) if the change exceeds two times the baseline standard deviation. For the other complexes, only a decrease is considered, and no explicit statement is given about a formal “two‐sided” model (that is, if an increase would be interpreted similarly). In other words, the approach for complex I sets different criteria for increases versus decreases, whereas for the other complexes only a decrease in activity is taken as an effect.

• No z‑factor has been determined or mentioned.  
• Specificity is described in qualitative terms—for example, the test method is stated to be sensitive to mitochondrial toxicants (with compounds such as cytoskeletal toxicants having no effect); however, no numerical specificity estimate is provided nor is the determination method described in quantitative detail.  
• Sensitivity is mentioned qualitatively (the test is sensitive to mitochondrial toxicants), but no numerical sensitivity data or a detailed determination procedure is given.

"Which compounds is the test likely to pick up correctly, where is it likely to fail? How does the test method react to mixtures and UVCBs?

Are any compounds known to interfere with the test system (e.g. fluorescent or colored chemicals)?",The test is sensitive to mitochondrial toxicants. E.g. cytoskeletal toxicants have no effect.,Low,"The answer provides minimal information, only mentioning sensitivity to mitochondrial toxicants and ineffectiveness for cytoskeletal toxicants. It does not address the test's reaction to mixtures and UVCBs, areas to exclude or include, undetectable compound classes, or interfering compounds.","Based on the information in the documents, the following points can be made:

1. Compounds that affect mitochondrial function are readily detected. For example, agents that inhibit mitochondrial respiration in general or specific mitochondrial complexes (such as inhibitors of complex I, III, or IV) are picked up reliably. In the MSL assay this is reflected by endpoints such as basal respiration, ATP production‐coupled respiration, proton leak, maximal respiration, spare capacity, and non‐mitochondrial respiration, whereas the MCL assay specifically quantifies inhibition of complexes I–IV (see sections 5.2–5.3 in both assay descriptions).  

2. In contrast, the test is not suited to detect toxicants that do not directly perturb mitochondrial energy metabolism. For instance, cytoskeletal toxicants have been explicitly mentioned as having no effect in these assays, meaning compounds whose mode of action is not mitochondrial but rely on affecting cell structure or other pathways (see Section 8.6 in the MCL description). Similarly, compounds that act via endocrine-disrupting mechanisms or neurotransmitters for which the corresponding receptors are not expressed in LUHMES cells would also likely not be detected.

3. With respect to mixtures and UVCBs, the provided documents do not describe how these types of substances perform in the assay. No specific information on mixture effects or UVCB analysis is given; hence, it is unclear if these would be interpreted reliably.

4. Regarding chemical properties and industry sectors, the assays are particularly suitable for compounds that are soluble (typically dissolved in DMSO, with a final concentration of 0.1% DMSO used) and that directly impair mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. On the other hand, compounds with poor solubility or those that interfere with detection should be approached with caution. For example, some compounds have been noted to show autofluorescence, which can interfere with the detection of the Hoechst cell stain (see section 6.5 and 6.9 regarding uncertainties and troubleshooting). These factors might require the exclusion of certain colored or fluorescent chemicals or additional controls when testing such substances.

It also fails to compare performance to similar tests, identify gaps in a test battery, or discuss the tier preference or need for complementary assays. The answer only lists some strengths and a specific effect, which is insufficient for the question's requirements.","The assay clearly fits into an integrated neurotoxicity testing battery. In the documents it is positioned as one component in a suite of LUHMES‐based assays that address different aspects of neurotoxicity. For example, it is cross‐referenced alongside the UKN3a/3b assays (neurite integrity) and the UKN4 (NeuriTox) or MCL (mitochondrial complex activity) assays. In that context, the MitoStressLUHMES assay can serve to detect mitochondrial dysfunction—a key mechanistic event (e.g. for AOPs related to complex‐I inhibition leading to parkinsonian deficits). 

Strengths include:
• An integrated, mechanistic readout of mitochondrial respiration from multiple parameters (basal respiration, ATP production, proton leak, etc.) which offers mechanistic follow‑up.
• Automated imaging (with internal controls) that helps exclude artefacts.
• High specificity for human dopaminergic neurons, which is useful when a mitochondrial adverse outcome is suspected.
• Good utility for screening and confirmation since an early alert on mitochondrial dysfunction can be validated by complementary endpoints (see cross‐reference with MCL for mitochondrial complex specificity).

Weaknesses or restrictions are:
• It is limited to a LUHMES‐based system, meaning that it does not cover other neural cell types or endpoints (like neurite outgrowth), so it does not replace broader neurotoxicity studies.
• The assay is not yet formally validated (eg, by OECD ring trials) and requires specialized instrumentation (Seahorse XF Analyzer) and advanced cell culture handling.
• It provides a read‐out that is specific for mitochondrial function; therefore, it is best employed as part of a battery rather than as a stand-alone screening tool for all neurotoxic endpoints.

In practice, the assay could be used in a first‐tier screening setup for generating alerts regarding mitochondrial impairment, or in later tiers as a mechanistic follow‑up on compounds that already show a neurotoxic signature in other assays. Depending on the testing strategy, complementary assays (such as neurite integrity tests or cell viability assays) are recommended for a more complete picture of neurotoxicity, although the strong mechanistic insight provided by the MitoStressLUHMES assay can make it a valuable stand‐alone component when focusing on mitochondrial dysfunction.

PMID: 34114044",Low,The answer provides a list of publications but does not address the specific request to indicate deviations from published descriptions or provide detailed comments on the type of information each publication contains. It lacks clarity and completeness in addressing the question's requirements.,"Below is a short summary that (a) indicates where our laboratory protocol deviates from some of the earlier published descriptions and (b) lists key publications that comprehensively describe the LUHMES‐based test system and/or the mitochondrial toxicity test methods, with comments on the types of information provided. 

1. Deviations from published descriptions  
 • Our protocol uses UKN LUHMES cells maintained and expanded from a masterstock derived in 2006. In contrast, published papers (e.g. Scholz et al., 2011) often describe the original derivation and differentiation conditions, whereas our assay emphasizes precise working stock passages (up to passage 18) and a more restricted post-thaw usage limit.  
 • The seeding density for the MitoStressLUHMES assay is set to 100,000 cells/well on Agilent Seahorse XFe24‐plates (after re‐plating on day 2), which may differ from densities reported by others in the literature.  
 • Our coating procedure specifies a combined poly‑L‑ornithine (43 µg/ml) and fibronectin (1 µg/ml) solution using defined water quality and storage conditions. Some published protocols may use alternative suppliers or slightly different concentrations.  
 • Regarding endpoint measurement, our method uses simultaneous OCR and ECAR readouts with a Seahorse XF Analyzer and a downstream high‑content imaging system (Cellomics) to count nuclei via Hoechst staining. In contrast, earlier publications sometimes focused on single endpoints (e.g. viability or neurite outgrowth) or used different analytical details.

Each of these publications contributes different layers of information—from fundamental cell properties and the original method development to detailed assay performance with chemical testing and validation steps. Researchers can use them to understand the evolution of the assay, compare cell seeding numbers, reagent suppliers (e.g. specific coating materials vs. alternatives), endpoint selection, timing differences, and inter-laboratory transferability aspects.

The deviations in our current protocol (e.g. choice of plate vendor, exact cell numbers, optimized timing, and high-content imaging for endpoint normalization) represent refinements based on laboratory‐specific trials and troubleshooting and aim to improve reproducibility while remaining consistent with the published method concepts.

In particular, the test method’s assessment of mitochondrial respiratory impairment (including inhibition of complex I) makes it suitable to cover the key event associated with AOP 3 (“Inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I of nigra‐striatal neurons leads to parkinsonian motor deficits”), as listed in AOP‑wiki. In this AOP, complex I inhibition acts as a molecular initiating event (MIE) and/or a KE that is causally linked to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, which the assay is designed to reflect.

For example, transcriptome data obtained during the differentiation process (from day 2 to day 10, EBI accession S‐TOXR1833) and studies on expression of neuronal markers (e.g. DAT and TH) support the view that these human dopaminergic neurons reflect key aspects of nigrostriatal biology relevant to mitochondrial toxicity. In the related MCL protocol, endpoint‐specific controls are defined (for example, using rotenone for complex I inhibition) and a decision model is provided to assign primary versus secondary effects, although a formal mechanistic validation (in terms of regulatory ring‐trials) has not been conducted.

In contrast, the companion MCL assay (MitoComplexesLUHMES) provides an example of early qualification where 32 unique compounds (as defined by unique DTXSIDs) have been tested successfully. This testing of a defined set of compounds supports the initial assessment of the assay’s performance, even though no complete OECD‑style validation or ring trials have been completed for either assay.

It does not describe where and how the SDSs are stored internally, how safe handling is ensured, or if the exposure scenario for the hazardous reagents is available.","The documents indicate that SDSs for all hazardous reagents and test compounds used in the assay are available. Specifically, under section 11.2 (“Safety data sheet (SDS)”), it is stated that “SDS are available in the university DaMaRIS database (Dangerous Materials Registry Information System)” (Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf, section 11.2). This implies that all hazardous reagents and test compounds’ SDSs are stored and maintained internally in that database.

Safe handling of these substances is ensured by following the manufacturer’s instructions and internal protocols. For example, the compounds are stored under conditions recommended by their manufacturers (e.g. DMSO is stored in a lightproof, air‑tight bottle at room temperature), and the work is performed in S1 cell culture laboratories which meet the required safety standards. In addition, the test method details proper handling procedures (such as careful pipetting and immediate documentation of any errors) to keep the cells and reagents safe from cross‐contamination or degradation (Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf, sections 6 and 11).

Regarding the exposure scenario for the hazardous reagents used in the test method, while the protocol provides detailed steps for compound handling and exposure (see sections 6.1 and 5.1 for compound addition and exposure scheme), no separate or specific “hazardous reagent exposure scenario” document is provided or referenced. The protocol integrates the exposure scheme into the general method, and no further exposure scenario description is available in the provided documents (Source: MitoStressLUHMESassay(MSL).pdf, sections 5 and 6).

In summary:
• Yes – all SDSs for hazardous reagents and test compounds are available and stored in the university DaMaRIS database.
• Safe handling is ensured by adherence to manufacturer instructions, use of designated S1 cell culture facilities, and strict internal handling procedures.
• The exposure scheme for test compounds is described as part of the assay protocol, but no separate detailed exposure scenario for the hazardous reagents is provided.
