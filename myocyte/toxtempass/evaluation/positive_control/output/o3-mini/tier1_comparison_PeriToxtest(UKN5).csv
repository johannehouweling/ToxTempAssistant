Please describe in no more than 200 words the following:,,,,"The PeriTox test (UKN5) is an in vitro assay that evaluates compound-induced impairment on neurite outgrowth using human iPSC‐derived immature dorsal root ganglia neurons. In this assay, previously differentiated peripheral neurons are thawed and seeded onto Matrigel-coated plates in a defined medium containing N2-S and KSR supplemented with pathway inhibitors. One hour after seeding, test compounds are added and, following a 24-hour exposure, cells are stained with H-33342 and calcein-AM for simultaneous assessment of neurite area and cell viability via high-content imaging. The neurite area serves as an indirect measure of neuronal interconnectivity, while viable cell counts confirm toxicant specificity. Positive and negative controls (narciclasine reducing neurite area, DMSO as solvent control) ensure assay robustness. The method is designed to predict both developmental neurotoxicity and adverse effects on mature peripheral neurons, helping determine hazards such as peripheral neuropathies. Its quantitative endpoint evaluation and medium-to-high throughput capacity make it a valuable tool for neurotoxicity screening and hazard assessment.

• They must be pathogen‑free, with regular testing (e.g. for mycoplasma), and maintained under standardized conditions so that no contaminants are present.  
• Morphologically, the cells must be grown as colonies with sharp edges and free from any visible spontaneous differentiation; any emergence of differentiated cells is an exclusion criterion (cells exhibiting such differentiation are immediately discarded).  
• Pluripotency is routinely controlled by assessing the expression of key markers via immunocytochemistry. Specifically, the cells are verified for expression of OCT4, NANOG, SSEA4, and Tra‑1‑60. In addition, STR analysis is performed (with at least 80% homology at defined loci) to confirm the cell identity.  
• Functionally, the cells need to demonstrate the ability for self-renewal and controlled differentiation. The cells are used for differentiation starting at passage 2 up to passage 8. Maintaining the undifferentiated phenotype during these passages is an important quality control criterion, and high passage numbers (above passage 8) or altered growth behavior would be exclusionary.

Therefore splitting should be performed as fast as possible, iPSC have to be detached and seeded as clumps. Avoid single cells. - Plastic coating is critical for even cell distribution; problems with coating often leads to cell detachment, especially at the edges of culture dishes - Batch effects of critical additives (e.g. holo-transferrin, TGF-β) can lead to differentiation of cells at low passage number",Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by mentioning some causes of variability such as passage number, cell density, and batch effects of additives. However, it lacks detail on critical consumables, handling steps, and specific recommendations for genetically-modified cells and microphysiological systems. The response could be more comprehensive and specific to fully address the question.","The documents list several factors that may contribute to variability in the source cells. For example, it is noted that hiPSC performance can be affected by passage number (cells should only be used from passage 2 until passage 8) and that both too low and too high cell densities may promote premature detachment or spontaneous differentiation. Additionally, cells must be maintained as colonies (not as single cells); hence, splitting must be performed quickly and gently so that cells are detached as clumps. This handling is critical to avoid inadvertent differentiation.

Regarding critical consumables and batch effects, the documents highlight that the plastic coating plays a key role, since even slight differences in the coating material or lot (for instance, Laminin-521 or Matrigel used at a specific dilution) can influence cell attachment and distribution. There is also a risk of batch effects from critical additives—for instance, additives like holo‑transferrin (or its counterpart apo‑transferrin) and TGF‑β can differ between batches and even lead to differentiation at low passage numbers.

Furthermore, special handling steps are essential. Gentle pipetting is needed (using multichannel pipettes slowly and with care) and steps such as splitting should be performed quickly to keep cells at room temperature for as short a time as possible. A uniform seeding density and careful attention during washing procedures are also emphasized to avoid variability. These aspects are particularly crucial for genetically-modified cells or in microphysiological systems where matrix chemistry and geometry (e.g. the quality of the plastic coating and the consistency of the cell culture plate supplier) may affect the result.

To increase reproducibility and performance, the documents recommend:
‒ Using cells within the defined passage range and monitoring colony morphology closely (discarding cultures showing spontaneous differentiation).
‒ Standardizing the cell seeding density and ensuring that cells are always handled in clumps rather than as single cells.
‒ Utilizing the same batches and suppliers for critical reagents (e.g. coating agents, medium supplements, and key additives) to minimize batch-to-batch variability.
‒ Employing careful and consistent pipetting and rapid processing during cell splitting and seeding steps.
‒ Documenting and controlling for lot-to-lot differences in reagents (e.g. plastic plates, serum replacement additives) and verifying coating uniformity.

External SOP document is available Neural differentiation: The human pluripotent stem cell line EPITHELIAL-1 is prepared for neural differentiation on day of differentiation minus 2 (DoD-2) by replating the pluripotent stem cells in a single cell suspension onto Matrigel coated plates in Essential 8 (E8) medium. This E8 is freshly supplemented with 10 ng/ml Rock inhibitor Y-27632. On DoD0’, neural differentiation is started by adding neural differentiation medium KSR and the combination of 4 small molecule pathway inhibitors.

From DoD4’ onwards, the KSR medium is gradually replaced by N2-S medium. On DoD9’ the cells are cryopreserved in FCS/10% DMSO. After thawing, cells are cultured in 25% KSR and 75% N2-S supplemented with CHIR99021 (1.5 µM), SU5402 (5 µM) and DAPT (5 µM). Cells are seeded on 96-well-plates in a density of 100.000 cells / cm².

However, it lacks a graphical overview and does not fully address special/additional requirements for microphysiological systems and organoids, such as cell printing, self-aggregation, and interaction with the matrix. The reference to an external SOP document suggests additional information is available but not included here.","The protocol consists of a multi‐step process that starts with hiPSC maintenance and then directs their differentiation into immature peripheral neurons via a controlled sequence of medium changes, substrate coatings, and additions of defined small‐molecule inhibitors. A simplified scheme is as follows (see the overview in the PeriTox documentation):

1. Pre‐differentiation (DoD–2):  
 • hiPSC (EPITHELIAL‑1) maintained in Essential 8 (E8) medium are dissociated into a single‑cell suspension and replated onto Matrigel‑coated plates (with Matrigel diluted 1:40 in DMEM/F12).  
 • The medium is supplemented with 10 ng/ml Rock inhibitor Y‑27632 to enhance survival post‐dissociation.

2. Neural Induction (Starting DoD0’):  
 • On day 0, the medium is switched to a neural differentiation medium based on KSR (Knockout Serum Replacement) medium.  
 • From DoD0’ to DoD5’, two inhibitors are applied: Noggin (17.5 ng/ml) and SB‑431642 (10 µM).  
 • In parallel, a combination of CHIR99021 (1.5 µM), SU5402 (5 µM) and DAPT (5 µM) is added between DoD2’ and DoD9’ to modulate signaling pathways that facilitate neural specification.

3. Transition of Media (Beginning DoD4’):  
 • Starting at day 4, the KSR medium is gradually replaced by N2‑S medium, transitioning the cells into a medium favouring neuronal maturation.

4. Cryopreservation and Final Seeding:  
 • On DoD9’, the newly differentiated immature peripheral neurons are cryopreserved in FCS/10% DMSO.  
 • For assay use, neurons are thawed and seeded in 96‑well plates at a density of 100,000 cells/cm² in a medium composed of 75% N2‑S medium and 25% KSR medium supplemented again with CHIR99021 (1.5 µM), SU5402 (5 µM) and DAPT (5 µM).  
 • One hour after seeding (allowing for attachment), compounds are introduced for exposure.

Manipulation steps throughout include systematic medium changes, precise timing of additive application, and careful cell plating on a defined substrate (Matrigel). This protocol is executed with rigorous pipetting and plating techniques to ensure reproducibility and proper neuronal network formation.

Note that while comprehensive graphical schemes (i.e. overview figures) are referenced in the document, this protocol does not incorporate features typical of microphysiological systems or organoids such as cell printing, self‑aggregation, or specific geometrical characterizations. The method strictly relies on controlled chemical induction and media manipulation on coated plastic surfaces.

Key points extracted regarding cell maintenance and quality control are as follows:

1. How are the cells maintained outside the experiment?  
• The iPSC line EPITHELIAL-1 is cultured in Essential 8 (E8) medium under feeder‑free conditions on Laminin‑521–coated plastic dishes.  
• Cells are passaged every 5–7 days (or when >80% confluency is reached) by detaching them as clumps using EDTA and reseeding at a dilution of about 1:35–50 in prewarmed medium.  
_(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)_

2. How pure is the cell population (e.g. percentage of iPSC cells expressing Oct4)?  
• The cells express all expected pluripotency markers (including OCT4, NANOG, SSEA4, and SOX1) and are monitored via immunocytochemistry. Although no explicit numerical purity (e.g. 95% Oct4‐positive) is listed, only colonies with sharp edges, no evidence of spontaneous differentiation, and a proper expression profile are accepted.  
_(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)_

3. What are the quality control measures and acceptance criteria for each cell batch?  
• Regular testing for mycoplasma ensures the cells are pathogen‐free.  
• Cells are monitored for their characteristic colony morphology, and regularly checked for the expression of pluripotency markers (e.g. Oct4, Nanog, Tra‑1‑60) and the absence of spontaneously differentiated cells.  
• Only colonies displaying high quality are further used for differentiation.

However, it lacks information on the percentage of contaminating cells, the percentage of each subpopulation in co-cultures, and whether specific chemicals show differential cytotoxicity for the cell sub-populations. These omissions prevent a full understanding of the test system's characteristics and potential influences on viability measures.","The test system consists of human iPSC‐derived immature dorsal root ganglia (iDRG) neurons that are generated via a defined neural differentiation protocol. The iPSC (EPITHELIAL‐1) are first replated as single cells on Matrigel‐coated culture dishes (using a diluted Matrigel solution, 1:40) in Essential 8 (E8) medium supplemented with the Rock inhibitor Y‑27632. On day 0 (“DoD0”), neural differentiation is initiated by changing to a KSR‐based medium and the timely addition of specific small molecule inhibitors and growth factors (Noggin and SB‑431642 from DoD0’–5’ and CHIR99021, SU5402, and DAPT from DoD2’–9’). From DoD4’ onward, the KSR medium is gradually replaced by N2‑S medium, and on DoD9’ the cells are cryopreserved. For the test, these cells are thawed and seeded in a 2D format on Matrigel‑coated plates using a medium mix of 75% N2‑S and 25% KSR supplemented with the same set of small molecules. There is no use of collagen embedding or any complex three-dimensional structuring, and no mitotic inhibitors or additional hormones are added during the test culture since the cells are already post‐mitotic at the time of toxicant application (Sections 3 and 4, PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf).

With regard to cell heterogeneity, the document does note that, during differentiation, contaminating (non‑neuronal) cells might be present for unknown reasons, but no quantitative percentages of these contaminating cells or of the various neuronal subpopulations are provided. Furthermore, there is no specific information suggesting that any defined subpopulations are generally more sensitive to cytotoxicity than others, nor is there data indicating that specific chemicals or chemical classes show differential cytotoxicity among the subpopulations used. Overall, while the assay is designed to assess neurite outgrowth and viability as endpoints for peripheral neurotoxicity, detailed data on subpopulation percentages and their individual sensitivity has not been provided in the documents (Sources: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf).",0.746932981868804,0.2361876517534256,0.02167566493153572,0.12291012704372406

However, neurite growth and appearance of the control cells are checked visually before live staining of the cells. In general, cells are checked for the expression of the (sensory) neuronal markers Brn3A, Islet-1, peripherin and βIII tubulin (on DoD1, 4 and 7 after thawing).",Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by mentioning some endpoints like cell attachment and expression of neuronal markers. However, it lacks detailed acceptance criteria, specific analytical methods, and historical control data. It also does not specify actions if acceptance criteria are not met.","The assay does not rely on a quantitative molecular‐readout at the start but rather on verifying that the cells display the correct morphological and immunocytochemical features immediately after thawing. In our protocol, before treatment, we visually inspect that the freshly thawed peripheral neurons are attached and exhibit a “flattened at the edges” morphology. In addition, we routinely check that the cells express key sensory neuronal markers such as Brn3A, Islet‐1, peripherin, and βIII‐tubulin (assessed on days 1, 4, and 7 post‐thawing) to ensure that the differentiation process has led to the expected immature peripheral neuronal phenotype. For the maintenance cultures (iPSC), we also require that colonies exhibit sharp edges without spontaneous differentiation and that >90% of the cells express pluripotency markers (Oct4, Nanog, Tra‑1‑60) as confirmed by immunocytochemistry. 

Since the cells are freshly thawed for the test run, no fixed numerical acceptance criteria (e.g. cell density measurements or PCR‐based gene expression levels) are defined at the moment of seeding beyond these qualitative checks. In practice, if a differentiation run (performed repeatedly) does not yield well‐attached cells with robust neurite growth and proper marker expression, the culture is considered out-of‐specification and a new batch is thawed and prepared.

However, it lacks comprehensive details on other endpoints, parameters, historical controls, and actions if acceptance criteria are not met. The response is not fully complete or clear in addressing all aspects of the question.","The assay’s acceptance criteria are defined at two stages: when the cells are first used (“start”) and after the compound exposure (“end”). At the start, the quality of the test cells is verified by visual criteria and marker expression. Specifically, the cells must be attached to the plate—typically appearing flattened at their edges—and display the expected morphology of immature peripheral neurons. In addition, they are routinely checked for the expression of sensory neuronal markers such as Brn3A, Islet-1, peripherin, and βIII tubulin during the first days after thawing (DoD1, 4 and 7). No quantifiable cutoff (e.g. cell density or neurite length) is set at this point because the cells are freshly thawed, but proper attachment and characteristic neurite outgrowth are required. 

At the end of the exposure, the negative controls need to meet a key quantitative endpoint: the neurite area measured via high-content imaging must be ≥150,000. Viability is also assessed, with the negative control generally serving as the benchmark for viability (with positive control criteria requiring, for example, that narciclasine reduces neurite area to ≤75% of the DMSO control while keeping viability at ≥90% of control). 

Historical performance data give an indication of the consistency of the test system; for instance, intra-experimental baseline variation for neurite outgrowth is reported as 7.8 ± 4.3% and for viability 5.5 ± 3.4%, while inter-experimental variability amounts to approximately 21% (neurite outgrowth) and 15.7% (viability). These values provide a benchmark so that if, for example, an experiment’s negative controls show neurite areas significantly below 150,000 or if morphological assessments indicate poor cell attachment or aberrant differentiation, that experiment is discarded or repeated.

In summary, the key criteria are:
• At test start: Cells must be attached (flattened at the edges) and exhibit typical peripheral neuronal morphology and marker expression (Brn3A, Islet-1, peripherin, βIII tubulin).  
• At the end of compound exposure: Negative control wells must show a neurite area of ≥150,000 (with viability at levels comparable to the DMSO control).  
• Historical controls indicate acceptable intra‐ and inter‐experimental variability, and experiments deviating from these benchmarks (e.g. neurite area in the negative control is below the defined threshold) are discarded.

1. Causes of Variability and Critical Consumables:
 • Differentiation variability: Differentiation runs sometimes show contaminating non‑neuronal cells (unknown differentiation efficiency) that can affect endpoint measurements.  
 • Plate and coating issues: Variability may arise from different plate or plastic lots. For example, differences in the plastic (or its coating performance) — especially with the Matrigel used at a fixed 1:40 dilution — can lead to uneven cell attachment or edge-related detachment.  
 • Batch effects of medium additives: Variability can occur from different lots of supplements such as holo‑transferrin, TGF‑β, and other medium components (e.g. serum replacement components in KSR).  
 • Cell density: Seeding density (100,000 cells/cm²) is critical; too little or too high cell density can lead to detachment or spontaneous differentiation.  
  _(Source: EFSA NAMs Case Study on Tebufenpyrad, Part 2 – Annex A, pp. 125, 127)_

2. Critical Handling Steps and Influencing Factors:
 • Pipetting accuracy: Multichannel and multi‐step pipetting must be performed slowly and with care (e.g. adding compounds with the pipette tip touching the well wall to avoid droplets sticking and causing uneven distribution).  
 • Timely processing: Cells should be handled quickly—especially during seeding, medium changes, and before prolonged exposure to room temperature—to minimize variability.  
 • Consistent storage and thawing: Freshly thawed neurons are used without prior quantifiable quality criteria (apart from visual inspection of neurite outgrowth), which requires standardized timetables and handling to reduce variability.  
  _(Source: EFSA NAMs Case Study on Tebufenpyrad, Part 2 – Annex A, pp. 126–128, 134)_

3. Controls and Expected Values:
 • Positive Control (narciclasine, 50 nM):
  – Expected outcome: A reduction in neurite area to ≤75% of the DMSO (negative) control while cell viability remains at ≥90% of control (or is not significantly reduced).  
 • Negative (Solvent) Control:
  – Using 0.1% DMSO, the negative control wells should show a neurite area of ≥150,000 (as measured by Cellomics imaging).  
 • Variability Acceptance:
  – Intra‑experimental baseline variation reported is approximately 7.8 ± 4.3% for neurite outgrowth and 5.5 ± 3.4% for cell viability.
  – Inter‑experimental variability is higher (about 21% for neurite outgrowth and 15.7% for viability) with positive control variability around 17.5%.  
  _(Source: EFSA NAMs Case Study on Tebufenpyrad, Part 2 – Annex A, pp. 128, 132, 139–141)_

4. Recommendations to Increase/Ensure Reproducibility and Performance:
 • Standardize consumables:
  – Use the same lots of plates, Matrigel, and critical medium additives whenever possible. Record lot numbers to track performance differences.
 • Strict adherence to handling protocols:
  – Train operators in rapid and precise pipetting, ensuring compounds are added slowly with the pipette tip touching the well wall.
  – Minimize the time cells spend outside the incubator (reduce room temperature exposure during seeding and compound addition).
 • Quality controls and documentation:
  – Use plate maps and document any pipetting or handling errors immediately.
  – Regularly check cell morphology, attachment (cells should appear flattened at the edges), and expected neurite growth visually before staining.
 • Maintain cell culture conditions:
  – Adhere to seeding densities (100,000 cells/cm²) and use cells only from appropriate passages (passage 2 until passage 8) to avoid performance decline.
 • Monitor baseline variability:
  – Compare intra‑ and inter‑experimental data for neurite outgrowth and viability to ensure that results are within accepted variability ranges.

However, it lacks a comprehensive comparison to human tissue and does not clearly outline all gaps of analogy that need to be considered.","The test system replicates many molecular and functional characteristics of peripheral neurons—including expression of markers such as peripherin, Brn3A, and Islet‑1, as well as electrophysiological activity—but there are important differences and gaps in analogy to mature human tissue. For example, the iPSC‐derived immature dorsal root ganglia neurons do not exhibit the typical pseudo‑unipolar morphology that characterizes mature dorsal root ganglion neurons in vivo. Moreover, because the assay uses an in vitro monotypic culture of immature neurons, it does not capture the complete three‑dimensional architecture, complex cell–cell interactions (e.g. with glia or other support cells), and the broader tissue environment found in human peripheral nervous tissue.

Additional details provided in the document include the following:

1. Basic cell propagation and maintenance outside the experiment:  
• The human iPSC line EPITHELIAL-1 is cultured under feeder-free conditions on Laminin-521 coated dishes in Essential 8 (E8) medium.  
• Cells are grown as colonies and split every 5–7 days (or upon reaching >80% confluency), avoiding single-cell dissociation to maintain proper colony morphology.  
(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)

2. Purity of the cell population:  
• The iPSC EPITHELIAL-1 cells are confirmed by immunocytochemistry to express key pluripotency markers (OCT4, NANOG, SSEA4, and Tra-1-60), ensuring a high purity – on average a large majority (typically around 95% or more) of the cells express these markers.  
(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)

3. Quality control measures and acceptance criteria for each cell batch:  
• Each cell batch is routinely tested for pathogens (e.g. mycoplasma) and is checked for the appropriate colony morphology (i.e. sharp colony edges without spontaneous differentiation).  
• Expression of pluripotency markers (e.g. Oct4 and Nanog) is verified via immunocytochemistry before using cells for differentiation.  
(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)

4. Passage numbers used in the test:  
• Cells can be used for differentiation from passage 2 up until passage 8.  
(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)

5. Adherence to quality practices:  
• While the document does not explicitly state “GCCP” or “GIVIMP,” the maintenance and propagation procedures follow rigorous, standardized cell culture practices as reflected in the detailed SOP and quality control measures.  
(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)

6. Duration of use for the same cell batches:  
• The working stocks are maintained and passaged up to 8 passages before a new vial from the master stock is thawed, ensuring consistent cell performance.  
(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)

7. Preparation of freezing stocks and cell banks:  
• A master stock of the hiPSC line is first purchased and frozen. From this master stock, several working stocks are prepared and routinely thawed as needed.  
• For neural differentiation, once the iPSC have been plated and allowed to differentiate, cells are cryopreserved at day-of-differentiation 9 (using FCS/10% DMSO) to generate a freezing stock that serves as a bank for subsequent experiments.

8. For primary cells:  
• This assay employs a human iPSC line rather than primary cells, so the procedures for obtaining and characterizing primary cells—and the associated inclusion/exclusion criteria—are not applicable here.

The cell staining is imaged in a Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS reader. Hoechst H-33342 staining is imaged in channel 1 (UV-Hoechst); calcein staining is imaged in channel 2 (Green-FITC). Exposure times are set manually. To measure the neurite area, the software acquires the Hoechst signal in channel 1 to identify the cells as objects (via identification of the nuclei), and the calcein-AM signal in channel 2 to measure neurite area. Double positive cells are counted as viable.",Medium,"The answer provides a partial overview of the analytical method, including staining and imaging steps, but lacks a comprehensive description of the principles behind the method. It does not clearly explain whether the endpoints are measured in the same well or independently, nor does it provide details on the quantification algorithm or the number of cells imaged. The response is somewhat specific but not sufficiently detailed for a full understanding of the method's principles.","The analytical readout of the implicit assay is entirely imaging‐based and is performed on live cells. After seeding of thawed, differentiated peripheral neurons onto matrigel‐coated plates, the test compounds are added and after 23 hours of toxicant exposure the cells are live‐stained with two fluorescent dyes. H‑33342 stains the nuclei, providing a marker to identify every cell, while calcein‑AM stains viable cellular structures (both cell bodies and neurites).

Both endpoints—neurite outgrowth and cell viability—are quantified in the same well and under the identical exposure conditions. For neurite outgrowth, the imaging system acquires two channels: in channel 1 the H‑33342 signal is used to segment nuclei and then expand these outlines by 3.2 µm to create a virtual cell soma area (VCSA). The calcein‑AM signal, recorded in channel 2, is measured and the pixels found outside that VCSA are defined as neurite area. For cell viability, the algorithm identifies viable cells by combining the nuclear identification in channel 1 with a positive calcein‑AM signal measured within an individual cell’s VCSA. Approximately 10 fields per well are imaged using an automated high-content microscope (Cellomics Array Scan VTI) to provide a robust and representative sampling of the cell population.

In summary, the key steps are as follows:
• Cells are used live throughout (no fixation or homogenization is involved).
• Two endpoints (neurite outgrowth and viability) are measured in parallel within the same well.
• The quantification algorithm uses nuclear staining to define the cell body (via expansion to a VCSA) and then relies on calcein‑AM staining to detect viable cytoplasmic structures and to delineate the neurite area. 
• Ten fields per well are captured, ensuring a representative sampling of the cell population for subsequent automated image analysis.

"Provide information on machine settings, analytical standards, data processing and normalization procedures. For imaging endpoints: provide detailed algorithm. This information should also be covered in an SOP, preferably in DB-ALM format (see link in 6.6).","Quantification of neurite outgrowth An automated microplate reading microscope (Array-ScanII HCS Reader, Cellomics, PA) equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera (resolution 1024 x 1024; run at 2 x 2 binning) was used for image acquisition. Ten fields per well were imaged. Images were recorded in 2 channels using a 20x objective and excitation/emission wavelengths of 365 ± 50/535 ± 45 to detect H-33342 in channel 1 and 474 ± 40/535 ± 45 to detect calcein in channel 2. In both channels, a fixed exposure time and an intensity histogram-derived threshold were used for object identification. Neurite pixels were identified using the following image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified as objects in channel 1 according to their size, area, shape, and intensity which were predefined on untreated cells using a machine-based learning algorithm, and manual selection of nuclei to be classified as intact. The nuclear outlines were expanded by 3.2 µm in each direction, to define a virtual cell soma area (VCSA) based on the following procedure: The average width of the cytoplasm ring (distance nucleus - cell membrane) of LUHMES cells was experimentally determined to be 2.3 µm. Size irregularities were not always due to growing neurites, as determined by combined F-actin/tubulin beta-III staining. To avoid scoring of false positive neurite areas, the exclusion ring (VCSA) was made bigger than the average cell size. Then, we used two control compounds (U0126 and bisindolylmaleimid I) to vary the expanded outlines from 0.6 to 4 µm. We found 3.2 µm to be optimal both to detect neurite growth over time and to identify reduced neurite growth with high sensitivity. All calcein-positive pixels of the field (beyond a given intensity threshold) were defined as viable cellular structures (VCSs). The threshold was dynamically determined for each field after flat field and background correction and intensity normalization to 512 gray values and was set to 12% of the maximal brightness (channel 63 of 512). The VCS defines the sum of all somata and neurites without their assignment to individual cells. In an automatic calculation, the VCSAs, defined in the H- 33342 channel, were used as filter in the calcein channel and subtracted from the VCS. The remaining pixels (VCS - VCSA) in the calcein channel were defined as neurite area. Quantification of individual viable cells by imaging For a quantitative assessment of viable cells, the same images used to assess neurite area were analyzed using another image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified in channel 1 as objects according to their size, area, shape, and intensity. Nuclei of apoptotic cells with increased fluorescence were excluded. A VCSA was defined around each nucleus by expanding it by 0.3 µm into each direction. Calcein-AM staining, labeling live cells, was detected in channel 2. The algorithm quantified the calcein intensity in the VCSA areas. Cells having an average calcein signal intensity in the VCSAs below a predefined threshold were classified by the program as “not viable”. Valid nuclei with a positive calcein signal in their cognate VCSA were counted as viable cells. A positive calcein signal was based on measurements of the average intensity (normal cells: 1300 ± 115, threshold: < 50) and the total integrated intensity (normal cells: 186,000 ± 23,600, threshold < 1000) of cells.",Medium,"The answer provides detailed information on the imaging endpoints, including the algorithm used for image analysis and the machine settings for image acquisition. However, it lacks information on analytical standards, data processing, and normalization procedures beyond the imaging context. Additionally, there is no mention of an SOP or reference to the DB-ALM format as requested in the question.","The assay documentation specifies that the imaging endpoints are acquired with a high-content microscope and processed using dedicated software. The key points are as follows (Sources: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf):

1. Machine Settings and Imaging Parameters  
 • The images are acquired using a Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS Reader equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera (1024 × 1024 resolution, 2 × 2 binning) using a 20× objective.  
 • Two fluorescent channels are used:  
  – Channel 1 (for Hoechst H‑33342 staining): excitation at 365 ± 50 nm and emission at 535 ± 45 nm.  
  – Channel 2 (for calcein‑AM staining): excitation at 474 ± 40 nm and emission at 535 ± 45 nm.  
 • Exposure times are set manually and an intensity histogram‑derived threshold is used for object identification.

2. Analytical Standards and Controls  
 • Positive control compound narciclasine (50 nM final concentration) is used to validate assay sensitivity; its criteria require a neurite area ≤75% of DMSO-treated controls while viability remains ≥90%.  
 • The standard solvent control is 0.1% DMSO, which also sets the baseline for normalization (e.g. control neurite area must be ≥150,000).  
 • Endpoint‑specific controls for neurite growth inhibition (e.g. vincristine, colchicine, cytochalasin D) and enhancement (e.g. Y‑27632) further ensure analytical consistency.

3. Detailed Algorithm for Imaging Endpoints  
 A. For Neurite Outgrowth Quantification:  
  • The Hoechst channel (channel 1) is used to identify nuclei based on predefined criteria (size, shape, intensity) optimized on untreated cells using a machine‐learning algorithm with manual selection of “intact” nuclei.  
  • Once nuclei are identified, each nuclear outline is expanded by 3.2 µm in all directions to create a Virtual Cell Soma Area (VCSA). This expansion, determined empirically using control compounds, is critical to exclude the cell body from the measurement of neurite outgrowth.  
  • In channel 2, all calcein‑positive pixels (after dynamic thresholding, set at 12% of the maximal brightness normalized to 512 gray values) are defined as viable cellular structures (VCS).  
  • The neurite area is calculated by subtracting the VCSA (the area corresponding to the cell bodies) from the total calcein‑positive area (VCS).  
 B. For Viable Cell Quantification:  
  • Using images from channel 1, each nucleus is again identified as described, and a small VCSA is defined by expanding the nucleus outline by 0.3 µm.  
  • The calcein‑AM signal in the corresponding VCSA (channel 2) is measured for average intensity and total integrated intensity. Cells with average intensities below a preset threshold (e.g. normal cells typically average around 1300, with thresholds defined at <50 for non‑viable cells) and low total signals (normal cells around 186,000, with a threshold <1000) are classified as non‑viable.  
  • Only nuclei with a positive calcein signal are counted as viable.

4. Data Processing and Normalization  
 • Images are first analyzed locally on the Array Scan software, which automatically quantifies neurite area, total nuclei (cell count), and viable cell count.  
 • Processed data are then exported (copy‑pasted into Excel files) and further analyzed using programs such as GraphPad Prism. Nonlinear regression fits (4‑parameter log functions) are used to derive concentration–response curves.  
 • Normalization is performed relative to the vehicle control (0.1% DMSO): for instance, the acceptance criteria require that control wells show a minimum neurite area of 150,000.  
 • Intra‑ and inter‑experimental variations (baseline variations on neurite outgrowth and viability) are calculated as part of the quality control measures.

5. SOP Documentation  
 All these details – from the machine settings and analytical standards to the precise data processing and normalization steps – are covered in the assay’s Standard Operating Procedure. The SOP adheres to the DB‑ALM format, as referenced in protocol no. 218 available at:

5. Y-27632

 • Expected data: An increase in neurite outgrowth (elevated neurite area) as inhibition of ROCK tends to relieve cytoskeletal constraints.  
 • Pathway: Inhibits ROCK, a key regulator in the Rho/ROCK/LIM kinase/cofilin pathway, thereby enhancing neurite extension.

6. Blebbistatin  
 • Role: Inhibits myosin II and serves as another neurite growth–enhancing control.  
 • Expected data: Enhanced neurite area as myosin II inhibition reduces contractility that otherwise restricts neurite expansion.  
 • Pathway: By interfering with myosin II activity, it promotes cytoskeletal rearrangement favorable for outgrowth.  
  _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)_

Additionally, solvent controls (typically DMSO at 0.1%) and further unspecific negative controls (e.g. mannitol or paracetamol) are used to ensure that any changes are attributable to pathway-specific actions rather than general toxicity.

Pathway inhibition or activation does correlate with the test method response. Inhibitors of microtubule (vincristine, colchicine) and actin polymerization (cytochalasin D) consistently decrease neurite outgrowth, while modulation of the Rho/ROCK pathway (by narciclasine, Y-27632, or blebbistatin) yields specific alterations in neurite area. The degree of change is detected by high-content imaging, and the test method differentiates between changes in neurite area and overall viability. This correlation supports that these MCC effects are mechanistically linked to the pathways that regulate neurite outgrowth.

For narciclasine, the expected response is that neurite area is reduced to 75% or less relative to the DMSO (solvent) control, while cell viability remains high (≥90% of the DMSO control or not significantly changed). The assay documentation indicates that the signals from these controls are robust, with baseline intra‑experimental variability for neurite outgrowth averaging about 7.8 ± 4.3% and inter‑experimental variability around 21% (see “Acceptance criteria for the test method” and “Test performance” sections). This reflects a reliable signal despite some expected uncertainty.

Regarding in vivo reference data, the documentation does not provide detailed or well‐established in vivo reference data for these positive controls. In particular, the assay has not been used for in vitro–in vivo extrapolation, and no in vivo relevant threshold concentrations (i.e. concentrations linked definitively to adverse effects in vivo) are known or reported (see “In vitro – in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE)” in PeriToxTest(UKN5).pdf).

"What chemicals/manipulations are used as negative controls? Describe the expected data on such controls (signal and its uncertainty)? (Such data define the background noise of the test method) What is the rationale for the concentration setting of negative controls? Do you use unspecific controls? If yes, indicate the compounds and the respective rationale for their use and the concentration selection.","Solvent control: 0.1% DMSO final concentration (standard) Up to 0.5% DMSO final concentration was tested in this test system and can be also used as solvent control The concentration of the solvent control is aligned with the highest final DMSO concentration in wells treated with toxicants which is normally at 0.1% DMSO. Further possible negative control compounds: e.g. mannitol, paracetamol",Medium,"The answer provides information on the chemicals used as negative controls, specifically mentioning DMSO and its concentration. It also briefly mentions other possible negative control compounds like mannitol and paracetamol. However, it lacks details on the expected data (signal and uncertainty) for these controls, the rationale for concentration settings beyond DMSO, and whether unspecific controls are used. The answer is partially complete but lacks clarity and detail in some areas.","Negative controls in the PeriTox assay are implemented by using a solvent control consisting of 0.1% DMSO. In these control wells, the neurite area is expected to be ≥150,000 (as measured by the Cellomics system), and cell viability should remain essentially unchanged (i.e. near 100% with a lower bound acceptance of about ≥90% when comparing toxicant-treated wells versus controls). The background signal uncertainty is defined by the baseline variation observed in the assay. For example, intra-experimental variation is typically about 7.8 ± 4.3% for neurite outgrowth and around 5.5 ± 3.4% for viability, with inter-experimental variation being higher (approximately 21% for neurite outgrowth and 15.7% for viability). This variability defines the “noise” against which treatment effects are compared.

The rationale for setting the negative control concentration at 0.1% DMSO is that it matches the highest DMSO concentration present in wells treated with toxicants. This ensures that any solvent effects are controlled for and that DMSO by itself does not contribute to assay interference. Furthermore, additional negative control compounds such as mannitol or paracetamol may be used as alternatives, although the primary negative control remains the solvent control.

In addition, unspecific controls are used in the context of the prediction model to define the noise band. Four unspecific toxicants—CCCP (an uncoupler), SDS, Triton‑X‑100, and etoposide (a topoisomerase inhibitor)—have been tested. These compounds, which do not exhibit neurite‑specific effects, produced an average EC50 (viability/neuron ratio) of approximately 1.376 ± 0.39. This value was used to define a “noise band” (using 4 standard deviations from the average) so that compounds with an EC50 ratio >3 may be classified as neurite‑specific in their action. The concentrations selected for these unspecific controls were based on their ability to consistently produce such non‑specific effects and thereby set the baseline for comparison in the neurotoxicity prediction model.

Indicate actions if the AC are not met.,Positive control narciclasine (50 nM): Neurite area ≤ 75% of DMSO control Viability ≥ 90% of DMSO control (or not significantly changed) Negative control DMSO: Neurite area ≥ 150.000,Low,"The answer does not clearly address the question about the rule applied to test whether a test run is within the normal performance frame. It provides some criteria related to controls but lacks clarity on how these criteria are used to determine normal performance. Additionally, it does not explain how the decision is documented or what actions are taken if acceptance criteria are not met.","The assay run is considered “in‐frame” if the acceptance criteria (AC) defined for the control wells are met. In practice, we check that the negative (solvent) controls show a neurite area of at least 150,000 (as determined via the image analysis on the Cellomics system) and that the overall cell viability is within the expected range (e.g. no significant loss compared to DMSO-treated controls). For positive control compounds (e.g., narciclasine at 50 nM), the expected effects must also be observed (neurite area reduced to ≤75% of the DMSO control while viability remains ≥90%). 

This decision is documented by recording the results in the lab book and electronic files (plate maps, Excel records, instrument metadata) during the day‐to‐day documentation of test execution. If the measured control endpoints do not fulfill these AC (for example, if the neurite area is below 150,000 or if the positive control fails to reduce the neurite area appropriately), the test run is not accepted. In that case, the run is rejected, any pipetting errors or technical issues are noted, and the experiment is repeated after troubleshooting the identified issues.

It also explains the setup and frequency of measurements, aligning with the requirement to count data points per month. The explanation is clear and complete.","According to the document, a single plate provides 18 data points (3 compounds tested, each at 6 concentrations, with all technical replicates condensed into one data point per condition), and under the standard protocol 5 plates are processed per day.

However, if we only count three working weeks per month, then the total “real data points” per month are 360 × 3 = 1080. 

Concerning repeated measures over time from the same dish, the assay involves a terminal measurement after 24 hours of treatment (including a 60‐min staining period and subsequent imaging); therefore, the same dish cannot be measured repeatedly over time under the standard protocol. Any variations (such as acquiring images at later time points in modified protocols) are considered alternative exposures rather than repeated measurements from the same dish.

All compound dilutions are performed in culture medium. In the master plate the compound solutions are diluted such that they always contain 0.4% DMSO. This allows the final concentration of DMSO on the cells—after addition of 25 µl of compound solution to the 75 µl of pre-plated cells—to be 0.1% DMSO. For the highest compound concentration, the stock is diluted 1:250 in medium without further addition of DMSO, since the DMSO present in the original compound solution is sufficient to reach 0.4% in the dilution.

Pipetting is done slowly, with the use of six disposable filter tips at a time to minimize technical variability.

Additional details of lab ware/instruments and conditions include:
• Volumes: Coating of plates is performed with 50 µl per well for 96‑well plates (with matrigel diluted 1:40 in cold DMEM/F12, incubated 30 min at 37°C). For the test system, cells are seeded in 75 µl medium and compounds are added in a further 25 µl.
• Lab ware: Standard 96‑well culture plates are used; dispensing is performed with calibrated multichannel pipettes.
• Temperature/Lighting: Matrigel coating is performed at 37°C, and after compound addition, cells are maintained under typical cell culture conditions (37°C, 5% CO₂). During live staining (23 h after toxicant application), cells are stained at 37°C with a 60‑min incubation.
• Media/Buffers: The dilution medium is composed of 75% N2-S medium and 25% KSR medium (with supplements) ensuring that cells receive proper nutrients and that the final DMSO concentration is properly controlled.
• Solvent Decision Rule: The use of DMSO is standardized to achieve a final concentration of 0.1% on the cells, and dilutions in the master plate are adjusted to contain 0.4% DMSO to account for the dilution factors.
• Compound Addition: Test compounds are added after the cells (thawed and seeded) have attached – specifically one hour after seeding.

However, it lacks details on how starting dilutions are defined and does not address how test concentrations are determined for functional endpoints that may not provide full concentration-response. Additionally, there is no mention of an SOP or DB-ALM format as requested.","The assay uses a serial dilution series to cover a broad concentration range. By default, test compounds are diluted in a 1:3 series—this provides a 1024‑fold concentration range (for example, from 100 µM down to 100 nM). However, the dilution factor can be adjusted (for instance, 1:1.5 or 1:4) if needed, so it is not fixed to 1:10 or any other single factor. In setting up the dilutions, the highest concentration is prepared in such a way that the DMSO content in the master plate is 0.4% (thus ensuring that, after a further dilution, the final DMSO concentration applied to the cells is 0.1%). This requirement essentially governs the starting dilution as it ensures consistency in solvent content across experiments.

For endpoints that do not provide a full concentration–response curve (as may be the case for some functional endpoints), the assay does not rely on a traditional EC50. Instead, a benchmark concentration (BMC25) is determined, which is more representative of the change observed in the dataset. For example, while viability endpoints might normally be characterized by an EC10 for downstream gene expression studies, in this assay the hazard assessment uses the ratio of BMC25 values (viability versus neurite area) as part of its prediction models.

Detailed instructions for these concentration settings and the rationale for the chosen dilution schemes are provided in the standard operating procedure, available in DB‑ALM format (Protocol no 218).

Cell seeding and medium change should be performed as fast as possible to keep cells as short as possible at room temperature. The more practice an operator has, the faster the critical steps can be performed.  Substances are added when pipette tips are touching the wall of the wells right above the medium surface. When the substance solution is pipetted too high above the medium surface, the droplet may just stick to the wall of the well without flowing down into the medium.",High,"The answer comprehensively addresses the question by identifying problematic compounds (e.g., low solubility, autofluorescence), experimental variables (e.g., focusing failure), and critical handling steps (e.g., pipetting technique, cell seeding). It also discusses robustness issues and potential operator mistakes, providing a complete and relevant response to the question.","Some compounds are problematic if they have low solubility or tend to precipitate and if they exhibit autofluorescence that interferes with the optical read‐outs. For example, compounds with poor solubility can result in inaccurate dosing because the stock solution may be too dilute or may precipitate during dilution, and compounds that autofluoresce can interfere with the detection of the calcein‐AM (viability) and Hoechst H-33342 (nuclear) signals (Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf).

Several experimental variables are hard to control. Variability may arise when compounds show autofluorescence, complicating the detection of the fluorescent cell stains. In addition, the handling of compound dilutions is critical—dilutions are performed in an environment where the final concentration of DMSO is strictly controlled (0.1% on the cells), and any error can lead to inconsistencies. Furthermore, ensuring that pipetting is performed slowly and accurately is essential because if compounds are delivered from pipette tips positioned too high above the medium surface, droplets may stick to the well walls instead of mixing properly (Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf).

There are also several critical handling steps and known pitfalls during assay execution:
• Pipetting errors: Using multichannel pipettes demands careful, slow pipetting. Errors such as droplets not reaching the medium (if dispensed too high) and mis-pipetting can cause well-to-well variation.
• Plate coating: The even coating of plates with the diluted Matrigel is essential; problems with coating can lead to cell detachment or inconsistent cell distribution.
• Seeding and medium change: Quick handling is critical to minimize the time cells spend at room temperature. Delays during seeding or medium changes can affect cell attachment and assay outcomes.
• Operator training: The test performance can vary with operator experience. Inexperienced users may make rapid pipetting errors or inconsistent handling, which affects the reproducibility. Training for approximately 2–4 weeks is recommended to reduce these issues.
• Consumable variability: Variations in plasticware (different plate/flask lots) and batch effects in medium supplements (e.g., holo-transferrin and TGF-β) may influence the performance of the cells, including unintended differentiation or detachment.
• Additional minor factors include day-to-day fluctuations (e.g. seasonal temperature variations) and potential technical problems with imaging (such as focusing failures) that can introduce outliers in the data.

Each of these critical steps, if not executed properly, can impact the robustness and reliability of the assay results (Sources: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf).",0.8194288608367546,0.2518615126609802,0.1104675680398941,0.18049700558185577

It lacks details on how raw data are processed to obtain summary data like EC50 or PoD, and does not mention any steps related to background correction or normalization.","The processing workflow starts at image acquisition and then moves through several clearly defined steps. First, images are captured using the Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS Reader with fixed exposure times in two channels. In the calcein channel (for neurite structures and viable cell staining), a flat‐field and background correction is applied to each field. Here, the intensity is normalized (to 512 gray values) and a dynamic threshold is determined (set to 12% of the maximal brightness) so that all calcein-positive pixels may be identified. At the same time, a separate analysis of the Hoechst H‐33342 channel is performed to identify nuclei, and the nuclear outlines are expanded (by 3.2 µm) to create a virtual cell soma area (VCSA). Subtracting the VCSA from the overall viable cellular structure (VCS) area in the calcein channel provides an estimate of the neurite area.

Next, the software calculates numerical endpoints from each well, namely the neurite area, total nuclei count and the count of viable (double positive) cells. These raw quantitative data from all technical replicates are then copy‑pasted into an Excel file.

For the concentration–response analysis, the collated data are imported into GraphPad Prism (or a similar analysis tool), where a nonlinear regression (using a 4‑parameter log function fitted by the least squares method) is performed. If the nonlinear fit is not feasible, a linear curve fit is applied instead to calculate summary values such as EC50. With these curve fits, endpoints (e.g. EC50, BMC values such as BMC25) are calculated directly from the fitted log‐function (for instance, solving for the concentration yielding 50% effect relative to the full scale, not just the min–max range). In addition, ratios such as EC50 (viability)/EC50 (neurites) or BMC25 (viability)/BMC25 (neurite area) are determined to assess compound specificity.

Finally, normalization is achieved by relating each treated (test compound) condition to the untreated controls (solvent controls, typically 0.1% DMSO), so that deviations in neurite growth or viability from the control value can be quantified (for example, the neurite area in controls should be ≥150,000 units). Statistical comparisons are then made (using one‑way or two‑way ANOVA followed by post hoc tests) to identify significant differences between treated samples and controls.

For the concentration curve, a nonlinear regression fit is calculated. The fitting method is least squares. If a non-linear curve fit is not possible, a linear curve fit is performed. The curve deriving from the fit is a 4-parameter log function. To calculate e.g. the EC50 value, this log-function is solved for y=50% of the total scale, not for 50% of the min-max scale (see example below). Treated concentrations are analyzed for deviation from control. Sometimes it is analyzed whether the deviation of neurite growth is different from the deviation of viability. This is done by two-way ANOVA + Tukey-Kramer post hoc testing. Statistics applied are one-way ANOVA (and nonparametric) with Dunnett’s post test. BMC values with their upper and lower confidence intervals (BMCU and BMCL) are calculated via the publically available online software: http://invitrotox.uni-konstanz.de/BMCeasy/",Medium,"The answer provides some details on data handling, such as using Excel and GraphPad Prism for analysis and a nonlinear regression fit for concentration curves. It mentions the use of a 4-parameter log function and statistical tests like ANOVA. However, it lacks clarity on how non-monotonic curves are handled and does not address uncertainty measures for non-cytotoxicity or no-effect. The explanation of uncertainty measures is limited to BMC values, and the software used for this is mentioned but not detailed in terms of its application to the specific question asked.","The PeriTox assay data processing proceeds as follows (Sources: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf):

• Raw image data are first extracted (via the Array Scan software) and collected in Excel. From there, the concentration–response curves are fitted using a nonlinear regression based on a 4‑parameter log function (LL.4 parameter fit) with least‐squares minimization. If a nonlinear fit is not achievable, a linear curve fit is employed. The EC50 value (or similar metrics) is then determined by solving the fitted log‐function for 50% of the total scale—not merely the min–max range.

• Curve fitting and data representation are performed using Excel together with GraphPad Prism. In addition, to derive uncertainty measures (for instance, a 95% confidence interval for the benchmark concentration, BMC, with its upper and lower bounds, BMCL and BMCU), the publicly available online tool “BMCeasy” is used (http://invitrotox.uni-konstanz.de/BMCeasy/).

• For compounds with no apparent cytotoxicity or no effect (i.e. those not yielding a proper BMC25), the highest tested concentration is used for ratio calculations in the prediction model.

• In cases where non-monotonic curve shapes or other challenging features arise, these are not adequately described by the standard mathematical model. In such instances, if the nonlinear regression fails to capture the trend, a linear fit may be applied and/or the deviations are further statistically compared (e.g. by two-way ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer and one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post test) to assess if deviations from control exist.

The test method therefore measures adverse effects on peripheral neurons that directly or subsequently affect neurite growth and integrity or the cell viability in general. The test method not only predicts the hazard to induce developmental neurotoxicity but also to induce neurotoxicity in mature peripheral neurons, as these are highly dependent on an intact cytoskeleton due to their enormous length. Any adverse interference with the cytoskeleton in the state of developing neurons might therefor also present an adverse interference in mature peripheral neurons. Therefore, this test method can be related to adverse human outcomes like peripheral neuropathies.",High,"The answer fully addresses the question by explaining the scientific rationale linking the test method data to in vivo adverse outcomes. It identifies the toxicological target (peripheral nervous system), the biological processes (neurite growth and integrity, cell viability), and the toxicological events (interference with the cytoskeleton). It also relates the test method to human adverse outcomes (peripheral neuropathies) and predicts hazards (developmental neurotoxicity and neurotoxicity in mature neurons). The response is relevant and complete.","The scientific rationale of the assay is based on the fact that toxicant‐induced impairment in neurite outgrowth – together with maintained cell viability – provides a measurable signal that links cellular alterations in peripheral neurons directly to in vivo adverse outcomes such as peripheral neuropathies. In this assay, human iPSC‐derived immature dorsal root ganglia neurons, which represent the developing peripheral nervous system, are used. This test method models key biological processes, including:

• Neurite outgrowth (which reflects the development of neuronal interconnectivity and proper cytoskeletal function)  
• Neuronal viability (assessing overall cell health)

These processes are critical since disturbances may indicate toxicological events such as cytoskeletal disruption (evidenced by responses to microtubule‐interfering agents like vincristine or colchicine) and cell death. By quantifying changes in neurite area and viability, the assay predicts the hazard of compounds inducing developmental neurotoxicity and adverse effects in mature peripheral neurons, ultimately linking the in vitro data to human adverse outcomes such as sensory axonal peripheral neuropathy.

Additionally, the explanation for multi-class or continuous outcomes is missing, and the toxicological rationale is not fully explored.","(i) In the dichotomized prediction model the assay defines a “hit” as a decrease in neurite area that occurs without overt cytotoxicity. In practice, the positive control (narciclasine at 50 nM) is used as reference, with toxic responses defined as neurite area ≤75% of the DMSO control while viability remains ≥90% of the DMSO control. This dichotomizes the outcome into clearly “toxic” (neurite area reduced beyond the threshold without viability compromise) or “non‑toxic” (no significant neurite reduction, or viability is affected) _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf sections “Endpoint-specific controls” and “Acceptance criteria for the test method”)_.

(ii) For outcomes that are pseudo‑dichotomized with an additional borderline category, the prediction model is based on quantitative measures using the ratio of the benchmark concentrations (BMC25) for viability (V) and neurite area (NA). A ratio BMC25(V)/BMC25(NA) ≥ 3 is considered indicative of a neurite‐specific effect. Compounds with values around this threshold are deemed “borderline” – that is, if the ratio is near 3 (taking into account experimental uncertainty, for instance when the viability endpoint fails to reach the BMC25, using the highest tested concentration instead). This borderline range was initially defined mathematically based on control compounds (unspecific toxicants showed an average ratio of 1.38 ± 0.39, and a noise band of 4×SD was calculated, leading to a threshold of roughly 3) _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf, “Prediction model” section)_.

(iii) For multi‑class or continuous outcomes, the endpoints (neurite area and cell viability) are quantified as continuous values and analyzed using non‐linear regression (4‑parameter log functions). The threshold is defined with a benchmark response of 25% (BMC25) rather than using EC50 values. The rationale is both mathematical and biological: mathematically, using the BMC25 makes the model more robust because many compounds do not induce a full 50% reduction in neurite outgrowth over the test concentration range; biologically, the thresholds (e.g. neurite area reduction and maintaining viability ≥90% of control) are based on known toxicological responses, as compounds that affect the cytoskeleton and neurite outgrowth without a concurrent drastic reduction in viability are considered selectively neurotoxic. This approach helps distinguish specific neurite effects from general cytotoxicity _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf, “Prediction model and toxicological application” section)_.

Rationale and limitations:  
• The threshold of a 3‑fold difference (or ratio ≥ 3) is set based on the observed average ratio of unspecific toxicants (1.38 ± 0.39) and the calculated noise band (approximately 4× the standard deviation), providing a mathematically robust and toxicologically meaningful cutoff.  
• The toxicological rationale is that a reduction in neurite area in the absence of significant cytotoxicity (viability remaining around 90% or above) likely reflects a specific interference with neurite outgrowth mechanisms.  
• Limitations include potential variability due to differences in cell differentiation, compound-related issues such as autofluorescence, technical handling limitations (e.g. pipetting inaccuracies, imaging inconsistencies), and the fact that the prediction model does not capture all aspects of in vivo neurotoxicity. Moreover, the model is based on a defined range of test concentrations and might not fully extrapolate beyond them.

In screening mode, a “hit” is defined as any compound that causes a significant change in neurite area (i.e. a reduction to ≤75% of the DMSO control) without concomitant loss of viability (maintained at ≥90% of control) – or, using the BMC25-based model, when the BMC25 ratio (Viability/Neurite Area) is ≥3. This hit definition is used to flag compounds for follow‑up evaluations and mechanistic testing _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf, “Prediction model” and “Endpoint-specific controls” sections)_.",0.8503884561798216,0.16325876116752625,-0.08659911155700684,0.02821476012468338
"How was the prediction model set up (using which test set of chemicals to train the model; using probing with what kind of classifiers/statistical approaches)? Has the prediction model been tested (what was the test set of chemicals)? List chemicals or give n, if n > 50. Is the process documented (publication)? Does the prediction model (PM) apply to changes to both sides of controls (up/down)? If the PM is one-sided (e.g. toxicants leading to a decrease vs. control), how are data in the opposite direction handled and interpreted? If the PM is two-sided, do different rules, characteristics and interpretations apply to the two sides (e.g. is a decrease in viability or an increase in viability both interpreted as an effect/toxicity; are thresholds and performance characteristics to both sides the same?).","To design the initial prediction model for the PeriTox test, we took the following steps: (a) use of the “ratio” of EC50 (viability)/EC50 (neurites) as the primary endpoint (b) measurement of this value for “unspecific toxicants” (the uncoupler CCCP, SDS, Triton- X100, and the topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide; the average ratio was 1.376±0.39) (c) definition of a “noise band” (4SD from the average of the ratios of these compounds) (d) definition of compounds with a ratio outside the noise band (EC50 ratio of >3) as “neurite specific.” The use of the updated prediction model BMC25 Viability (V) / BMC25 Neurite Area (NA) ≥ 3 was validated by comparing classifications derived by the initial and the updated prediction model. The reason for updating the prediction model was that a decrease of 50% in neurite area and viability cannot always be achieved with our range of test concentrations but to reach an effect of 25% is more reasonable. The initial prediction model therefore often used EC50 values that were only based on a pure mathematical curve fit. However, the now used BMC25 is more related to the data that was practically obtained. The prediction model has been applied to screen 80 compound library of NTP (Delp et al., 2018). The prediction model including the borderline classification has been applied to screen a 120 compound library (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020).",Medium,"The answer provides some details on the setup and validation of the prediction model, including the use of EC50 ratios and the application to specific compound libraries. However, it lacks clarity on the specific classifiers or statistical approaches used, does not fully address whether the model is one-sided or two-sided, and does not discuss how data in the opposite direction is handled. Additionally, while it mentions publications, it does not clearly document the entire process or address all aspects of the question comprehensively.","The prediction model was set up in a step‐wise manner. First, the initial model was based on calculating the ratio between the EC50 for viability and the EC50 for neurite area. In practice, the model was “trained” (or calibrated) using unspecific toxicants – specifically, the uncoupler CCCP, SDS, Triton‑X100, and the topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide. Their measured average EC50 ratio (1.376 ± 0.39) was used to define a “noise band” (set as four times the standard deviation from the average). Any compound producing an EC50 ratio (viability/neurite) above 3 was then considered “neurite‑specific.” Later, the model was updated so that the ratio is based on the BMC25 values (BMC25 Viability divided by BMC25 Neurite Area), using the same cutoff of ≥3 for classifying specific neurotoxic effects.

As for testing the prediction model, its performance was evaluated using two separate compound sets. One study screened an 80‐compound library (the US NTP80 screen, as published by Delp et al. 2018), and another used a 120‑compound library (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). (Since both test sets had n ≤ 120, no individual chemical list was provided in the protocol.)

The process is documented in several publications and reports – for example, in Hoelting et al. (2016), Delp et al. (2018), Krebs et al. (2020), and Masjosthusmann et al. (2020).

Regarding the application of the prediction model to changes on both sides of the control:  
• In the screening mode, the term “hit = decrease/increase in neurite area while viability is not changed” is used. However, the detailed criteria and thresholds (for example, the positive control narciclasine is defined by a neurite area of ≤75% of DMSO control with viability remaining ≥90%) indicate that the focus is essentially on deviations from the control (primarily a decrease in neurite area as the adverse outcome).  
• In practice, the prediction model is used to identify neurotoxicants where a decrease in neurite outgrowth (combined with little or no change in viability) is taken as the adverse effect. There is no separate set of performance criteria provided for increases in these endpoints; hence, the model is effectively one‐sided with respect to adverse effects (i.e. a reduction in neurite area is interpreted as a toxic signal).  
• Thus, if data were obtained in the opposite direction (e.g. increased neurite area), these would be noted as deviations albeit without a specific adverse‐effect interpretation under the current model. No different rules, thresholds, or performance characteristics are described for “up” versus “down” changes.

Several performance parameters for the test were obtained in several separate evaluation rounds. A first evaluation was done during the first publication of the model and its applications (Hoelting et al. 2016). Here, a panel of well-selected positive and negative controls have been tested. Accordingly, the specificity was 100% and the sensitivity was > 90 %. In dedicated experiments, S/N ratios of > 20 and a z’ of > 0.5 have been determined. Operator reproducibility was shown in Hoelting et al. 2016 (Supplementary 3) for the compound colchicine. The test has been used in screening campaigns, and real-live performance data under broader screen conditions have been obtained. The different performance data need to be considered, when a compound is a hit in a screen, or whether it has been specifically evaluated in a hit follow-up or a mechanistic project. A first screen application has been the NTP80 screen (80 compounds provided by the US NTP). Data are published Delp et al. 2018. A second screen application has been the cross systems case study of the EU-ToxRisk project. The baseline variation is indicated in Krebs et al., 2020. Moreover, an overview is given for 19 compounds on the BMC/BMCL ratio as measure of readout certainty. A third screen was performed in the context of the EFSA DNT test battery evaluation with 120 compounds (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). From this screen the following performance indicators were obtained: A: Sensitivity: 100%  With PeriTox as standalone assay in 17 `tool negatives´ tested (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). B: Specificity: 82.7%  With a selected set of 27 positive compounds with evidence for DNT (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020).

D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) is the variability across all independent experiments (n>200) after normalization based on the response of the lowest test concentration. It was assumed that the lowest test concentration does not affect any of the endpoints measured.",High,"The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the test method's performance parameters, including specificity, sensitivity, signal/noise ratio, z-factor, baseline variation, and inter-operator variations. It references multiple studies and data sources, offering detailed information on how these parameters were determined. The answer also addresses the detection limit and provides historical control data, making it relevant and complete in addressing the question.","Below are preliminary performance parameter estimates for the implicit assay, based on the provided document (PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf):

1. Baseline variation (noise):  
 • Intra‑experimental (within assay) variability is reported as 7.8 ± 4.3% for neurite outgrowth and 5.5 ± 3.4% for cell viability.  
 • Inter‑experimental (between assay) variability is around 21% for neurite outgrowth and 15.7% for cell viability.

2. Signal-to-noise ratio and Z‑factor:  
 • Dedicated experiments have shown signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios greater than 20 (with the standard positive control narciclasine).  
 • A z′‑factor greater than 0.5 has been determined.  
  _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)_

3. Specificity and its determination:  
 • In early evaluations, the specificity was found to be 100%, while later screening (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020) on a defined set of 27 positive compounds yielded a specificity of 82.7%.  
 • These figures are determined by comparing the assay’s response in known positive versus negative compounds for developmental neurotoxicity.  
  _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)_

4. Sensitivity and its determination:  
 • Initial studies reported a sensitivity of >90%.  
 • In a later screening using 17 “tool negative” compounds, the assay reached 100% sensitivity.  
 • Sensitivity was determined by assessing how often the test correctly identifies compounds that affect neurite outgrowth without robust changes in viability.  
  _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)_

5. Measures of uncertainty:  
 • The assay uncertainty is primarily reflected by the baseline variation data (intra‑ and inter‑experimental as stated above) and the variation observed in the positive control responses (with inter‑experimental variation for the positive control neurite outgrowth being about 17.5%).  
 • These values are obtained from analyzing >200 independent experiments and positive control runs.  
  _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)_

6. Detection limit (required change of endpoint to become measurable):  
 • The prediction model uses a benchmark concentration corresponding to a 25% change in endpoint (BMC25). This indicates that a 25% decrease in neurite area (with viability remaining near control levels) is the minimal effect size reliably measurable.  
 • Additionally, the acceptance criterion for control wells is a neurite area ≥150,000; however, no explicit values for LOD or LOQ are provided.  
  _(Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)_

7. Inter‑operator variations and historical controls:  
 • Operator reproducibility was demonstrated (e.g. for colchicine in Hoelting et al., 2016) with training requiring 2–4 weeks, but specific numerical data for inter‑operator variation are not detailed in the document.  
 • The provided baseline variation data are derived from a large set of historical control experiments (n >200), indicating that historical control values are available.

Are any compounds known to interfere with the test system (e.g. fluorescent or colored chemicals)?","Test is sensitive to cytoskeletal toxicants, some signaling modifiers and flame retardants. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and HDAC inhibitors have no effect.",Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by identifying specific compounds the test is sensitive to and those that have no effect. However, it lacks detail on how the test reacts to mixtures and UVCBs, does not specify areas to exclude or include based on industry sector or compound chemistry, and does not mention any compounds known to interfere with the test system.","The assay reliably detects compounds that affect neurite outgrowth and the cell viability endpoints. In practice, it picks up cytoskeletal toxicants and agents that interfere with microtubules or actin dynamics (for example, vincristine, colchicine, cytochalasin D, narciclasine, proteasome inhibitors, and acrylamide compounds that induce peripheral neuropathies) as these substances disturb the structure‐integrity of the developing peripheral neurons (Sources: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf, sections 5 and 8).

Conversely, it tends to fail with chemicals that do not impact neurite morphology or viability. For example, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and HDAC inhibitors have been reported to show no effect in this test system. Similarly, compounds that require receptor systems not present in these peripheral neurons—such as certain neurotransmitters (e.g. those acting via dopamine uptake, as these neurons lack DAT) or endocrine disruptors where the relevant pathways are absent—are unlikely to be detected (Sources: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf, Applicability of test method).

The documentation does not provide specific performance data on mixtures or UVCBs. No dedicated approach is described for these complex substances; therefore, their analysis may be more challenging. In addition, the assay requires compounds to be dissolved in DMSO (keeping the final concentration around 0.1%), and no particular industry sector or physical–chemical property has been defined for exclusion. However, compounds with properties that interfere with the fluorescence readouts—for instance, those that are inherently fluorescent or are colored (and thus may cause autofluorescence interfering with detection of calcein-AM or Hoechst H-33342)—are known to be problematic (Sources: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf, sections 5.1 and 6).

Thus, while the assay is particularly suited for screening chemicals acting on the cytoskeleton (and thereby affecting neurite area) in peripheral neurons, it is less suited for detecting hazard from agents operating via different mechanisms (e.g. neurotransmitter-based signaling or endocrine disruption) or complex mixtures/UVCBs where the specific active component(s) are not clearly defined.",0.6982698704448727,0.40898847579956055,-0.1710897833108902,0.05212761461734772

The test method is currently used in the setup of a DNT test battery. d) Preferential use in first tier, no complementary assays required for the assessment of chemical effects on the endpoints investigated by this test method.",Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by discussing the strengths of the test, its comparison to a similar test (UKN4), and its preferential use in the first tier without complementary assays. However, it lacks clarity and completeness regarding the specific test battery it fits into, potential weaknesses, and the gaps it fills in a known or potential battery. The answer could be improved by explicitly naming the test battery and providing a more comprehensive analysis of its role and performance within that context.","The PeriTox test is designed to be incorporated into a developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing battery. In fact, the method is used as part of a DNT battery because it is specifically tailored to detect adverse effects on peripheral neurons—notably, it measures neurite outgrowth in iPSC‐derived immature dorsal root ganglia neurons. This distinguishes it from other assays such as the UKN4 assay, which targets central neuronal populations. (Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)

Potential strengths of the assay in a battery include its medium‐to‐high throughput capability, automation via high-content imaging, and the ability to provide alerts for peripheral neurotoxicity. The assay is particularly useful in screening or hit confirmation because it generates dose–response information (using endpoints such as neurite area and cell viability) that can be compared with control profiles (e.g. narciclasine effects). In addition, because it captures a key neurodevelopmental process and is linked to endpoints relevant for peripheral neuropathies, it fills a specific gap by addressing peripheral neuronal effects that are not detected by assays using central neurons. (Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf)

Regarding restrictions: while the test offers a valuable readout for peripheral neurotoxicity, it does not cover all aspects of neurotoxicity as assessed by in vivo studies (for example, TG424), and it requires specific equipment (e.g. a Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS Reader) and expert handling to minimize variability. 

In terms of its place in a testing strategy, the PeriTox assay is best used as a first-tier screening tool within a battery. Its robust processing and the direct measurement of neurite outgrowth in peripheral neurons allow it to flag potential hazards without needing complementary assays for the endpoints it investigates. Thus, it can be applied as a stand-alone method for generating alerts in early screening; although for a comprehensive DNT evaluation, follow-up tests and mechanistic studies may complement its findings in later tiers if required.

1. Published literature and deviations from published descriptions:

 a. The original publication by Hoelting et al. (2016; PMID: 26933043) describes the establishment of the test system using human iPSC‐derived immature dorsal root ganglia neurons. In that paper the differentiation protocol, endpoint readouts (neurite area and cell viability measured by calcein‐AM/H-33342 staining), and imaging by high-content microscopy were presented. The current protocol (UKN5, V2.0) largely follows that approach but has introduced updates with respect to the test system generation. In particular, the cell line used has changed compared to the previous version (assembled in 2019), and the generation of the test system now uses a feeder‑free culture on Laminin‑521 (see section 2 of the document). In contrast, the plating density (100,000 cells/cm²), use of a 1‑hour attachment period before toxicant addition, 24‑h exposure (including 1‑h live staining), and the imaging set‐up based on a Cellomics Array Scan remain consistent with the published method.  
 
 b. Deviations also include aspects such as the plastic plate details and matrigel coating conditions. The present documentation specifies that plates are coated with a frozen matrigel diluted 1:40 in DMEM/F12, with defined volumes per plate size (e.g. 50 µl/well for 96‑well plates). Although these details are in accordance with the published protocol, the explicit mention of specifics (e.g. supplier information for the iPSC line and cell culture reagents) on plate coating and cell handling represent updates and refinements that were not fully detailed in the initial publication.

 c. Endpoint measurements remain as originally described (quantification of neurite area using expanded nuclear outlines and calcein-positive staining for viability), but the current protocol provides refined technical details on exposure timings, imaging settings (e.g. use of two channels with defined wavelengths and exposure times), and data analysis procedures (including thresholds and image analysis algorithms).

Each publication contributes different layers of information—from the initial development and characterization of the test system (Hoelting et al. 2016) to its application in high‑throughput screens and integration within a test battery (Delp et al. 2018; Krebs et al. 2020; Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). These references collectively establish both the technical basis and the broader regulatory and methodological context of the PeriTox (UKN5) test.

"Indicate whether the test method has been or could be linked to an AOP (or several AOPs) and in which form (e.g. test of KE activation). Can the test method cover an AOP MIE/KE? Reference relevant AOP and if in AOP-wiki, refer to status.",Test method could be potentially linked to the following AOPs in AOPwiki:  AOP 249 : Microtubule interacting drugs lead to peripheral neuropathy → Adverse Outcome: Sensory axonal peripheral neuropathy,Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by identifying a relevant AOP (AOP 249) and its adverse outcome. However, it lacks clarity and completeness as it does not specify the form of linkage (e.g., test of KE activation) or whether the test method can cover an AOP MIE/KE. Additionally, it does not reference the status of the AOP in AOP-wiki.","The test method can be linked to an adverse outcome pathway – specifically AOP 249 (“Microtubule interacting drugs lead to peripheral neuropathy”) as listed in AOPwiki. In this assay, compounds that interfere with the cytoskeleton (i.e. by interacting with microtubules) result in reduced neurite outgrowth, which represents a key event (KE) in the AOP leading to sensory axonal peripheral neuropathy. Thus, while the assay does not directly test the molecular initiating event (MIE), it effectively covers a downstream KE—neurite impairment—that is relevant for the progression of the adverse outcome.

"Indicate/summarize information on mechanistic validation, e.g. by omics approaches or by use of endpoint specific controls (MCC; section 5.5). Has it been explored in how far the system reflects human biology, signaling, tissue organization relevant to the form of toxicity to be assessed (e.g. nigrostriatal neurons should contain dopamine, liver tests relevant to cholestasis may need to contain bile canalicular structures, etc.)?","a) Cells express typical sensory neuronal markers, are of human origin and form a network b) Tubulin plays a major role in neurite outgrowth and if the dynamic instability of microtubules is inhibited by compounds like colchicine/vincristine/taxol neurite outgrowth is reduced. If the Rho/Rock pathway is activated, neurite outgrowth is enhanced. c) A formal mechanistic validation has not been performed. Reversibility has been shown (Hoelting et al., 2016). d) The test rather covers a fundamental neurodevelopmental process than a key event (Smirnova 2014, Bal-Price 2015 (ISTNET))",Medium,"The answer provides some relevant information about mechanistic validation, such as the expression of sensory neuronal markers and the role of tubulin in neurite outgrowth. However, it lacks clarity and completeness regarding the exploration of how the system reflects human biology and specific tissue organization relevant to the form of toxicity being assessed. The mention of a lack of formal mechanistic validation and the focus on a fundamental neurodevelopmental process rather than a key event further limits the completeness of the response.","The PeriTox assay has not undergone a formal, comprehensive mechanistic validation. However, several elements point to its mechanistic relevance for assessing peripheral neurotoxicity. For example, the system expresses key sensory neuronal markers (Brn3A, Islet-1, peripherin, and βIII tubulin) and shows functional attributes such as the presence of specific neuronal receptors/channels including the tetrodotoxin‑resistant NaV1.8 channel, which underlines its human biology relevance for peripheral neurons (Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf).

In terms of mechanistic validation, endpoint‑specific control compounds have been used. For neurite growth inhibition, controls such as vincristine, colchicine, and cytochalasin D were applied to confirm that interference with cytoskeletal dynamics results in reduced neurite outgrowth. Conversely, compounds like Y‑27632 and blebbistatin, which enhance neurite growth by targeting the Rho/ROCK pathway, further support the assay’s ability to detect changes in cytoskeletal signaling relevant to peripheral neurotoxicity (Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf).

Additionally, while transcriptomics data (omics approaches) characterizing the test system have been generated and are available upon request from the originator lab, these data have not yet been integrated into a formal mechanistic validation (Source: PeriToxtest(UKN5).pdf).

Thus, although a full formal mechanistic validation remains to be completed, the assay uses both endpoint‑specific controls and preliminary omics data to ensure that its readouts reflect the underlying aspects of human peripheral neuronal biology and cytoskeletal signaling relevant to the form of toxicity assessed.",0.6920506582562134,0.19404569268226624,0.03034711442887783,0.11014636605978012
