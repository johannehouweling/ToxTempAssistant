Please describe in no more than 200 words the following:,"The human developing central nervous system may be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of chemical agents than the adult brain. At present, due to the knowledge gap concerning hazard identification for human neurodevelopmental toxicity (DNT), there is an urgent need for testing and subsequent regulation of chemicals for their potential to interfere with the developing nervous system. Primary human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) cultivated as three-dimensional floating spheres are able to represent several key processes during brain development. In the neural progenitor cell migration and differentiation assay (NPC2-5), hNPCs are plated on an extracellular matrix, and migrate and differentiate out of the sphere core. Thereby the processes radial glia migration, migration of neurons and oligodendrocytes as well as differentiation into neurons and oligodendrocytes and neurite outgrowth can be studied. Those DNT-specific endpoints are studied in combination with general cell viability and cytotoxicity. Cell migration and differentiation are critical processes during brain development that, if disturbed, lead to alterations in brain development and may cause cognitive dysfunction. Currently, cortical NPC migration- and differentiation-related processes are some of the many processes, which are assessed in the OECD TG426 by neuropathological evaluation of certain brain regions as well as neurobehavioral tests. According to the readiness criteria as published by Bal-Price et al. (2018), the neural progenitor cell migration and differentiation assay obtained readiness scores between A and B depending on the endpoint.",Medium,"The answer provides a detailed description of the vulnerability of the developing central nervous system to chemical agents and the need for testing. It explains the use of human neural progenitor cells in assays to study neurodevelopmental toxicity, mentioning specific processes and endpoints. However, it lacks clarity on how this directly addresses the question, which seems to require a concise description of a specific method or process. The answer is informative but could be more focused and concise to fully meet the question's requirements.","The NPC2-5 assay evaluates human neural progenitor cell (hNPC) migration and differentiation to assess developmental neurotoxicity. In this assay, primary hNPCs isolated from the human fetal cortex are cultured as three‐dimensional neurospheres and then plated on poly-D-lysine/laminin-coated 96-well plates in differentiation medium. Over a period of up to 120 hours, cells migrate radially from the core, differentiating into radial glia, neurons, and oligodendrocytes. Migration is quantified by measuring the distance from the sphere core to the edge of the migration zone using brightfield and immunocytochemical imaging. Additional endpoints include neuronal differentiation (percentage of β-III-tubulin-positive cells), neurite outgrowth (neurite length and area), and oligodendrocyte differentiation (percentage of O4-positive cells). The assay uses automated high-content imaging and analysis software to obtain quantified endpoints while incorporating controls such as PP2, EGF, and BMP7 to validate endpoint-specific responses. This method provides a human-relevant platform for investigating chemical impacts on critical neurodevelopmental processes and is designed for integration in an in vitro developmental neurotoxicity testing battery.

1. A detailed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in DB‑ALM format (Appendix J) that contains protocols for maintenance culture, cell thawing, passaging, plating, and subsequent handling during compound exposure.  
2. A metadata file (“AXES sheet”) in Excel format, which collects all experiment‐related metadata (e.g. sample/plate maps, cell source details, dates, compound and concentration information) together with the raw data.
3. Raw data files that are generated from the assay endpoints. These include Excel files for viability and cytotoxicity measurements (with data given as relative fluorescence units) and CSV files exported from the Omnisphero software that contain data on cell number, migration distances, neurite parameters, etc.

 – There is an established assessment of cell identity. FACS analysis confirms the expression of the key markers, and post‐differentiation testing (e.g. TUBB3 and GFAP positivity) must be fulfilled.
 – Prior to use in the assay, neurospheres should have a defined size (for instance, an acceptable diameter between 0.25–0.35 mm) to ensure consistency in plating and subsequent migration/differentiation behavior.

• Functional parameters:
 – The cells’ ability to respond to growth factors must be demonstrated. In proliferation, they are exposed to EGF and FGF, which increase proliferation, whereas pharmacological inhibition (with PD153035) blocks this increase.
 – The reproducible response to these stimuli confirms both their functional identity and the quality of the batch.
 – In the later stages, when the cells are induced to differentiate, defined endpoints (e.g. the generation of at least 1.5% neurons or oligodendrocytes within the migration area) further confirm that the cells behave as expected.

• Stability and exclusion criteria:
 – Stability is inferred from the predictable proliferative capacity and the maintenance of marker expression upon passaging. In this assay, cells are expanded over 3–4 weeks and passaged weekly with neurospheres consistently reaching the required size for assay use.
 – Deviations from expected morphology (e.g. irregular sphere shape or size), contamination, or a lack of proper marker expression (both in proliferative and differentiated stages) are exclusion criteria and warrant rejection of that batch.
 – Although the description focuses on primary cells rather than iPSCs, similar principles would apply—ensuring pluripotency is controlled via marker expression and functional assays if iPSCs were used. For primary cells, the supplier’s control of donor‐to‐donor variability and consistent xenobiotic responses (e.g. functional responses to reference compounds) also serves to establish stability over passages.

In summary, the overall acceptance criteria include:
 – Identity: Verified expression of lineage‐specific (nestin, SOX2, Ki67) and differentiation markers (TUBB3, GFAP).
 – Purity: A pathogen‑free, sterile, mycoplasma‑negative status.
 – Viability and Cell Count: At least 20% viability and a defined cell concentration (approximately 1.2×10^6 cells/mL).
 – Functional responses: Expected proliferative response to growth factors, inhibition by reference inhibitors, and defined dimensions of neurospheres.
 – Exclusion: Any evidence of contamination, aberrant marker expression, or irregular morphology.

These defined quantitative and qualitative parameters ensure a reproducible and functionally robust cell model for the NPC2‑5 assay.

In the 3- to 4-week expansion period different donors can show differences in their proliferative capacity (spheres need longer, 3 instead of 4 weeks, to reach the acceptable minimum size of 0.2 – 0.5 µm). After the first mechanical dissociation, there are no observable or measurable inter-individual differences. Critical consumables The proliferation medium does not contain serum or serum replacement. The use of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is critical for sphere growth. FGF contains 1% bovine serum albumin and is thus prone to batch effects. Critical handling The thawing medium contains DMSO in a concentration that affects cell health which is why thawed cells should quickly be diluted in proliferation medium (30 mL of media for one vial of cells). It is recommended to add FGF into the proliferation medium directly before thawing. At the end of week two of the expansion period (see below), the spheres should be transferred to petri dishes coated with poly-(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly-Hema) to prevent cell attachment. Attached cells that are not differentiated can be gently detached using a 1000 µL pipet. To avoid repeated attachment, all cells should be transferred to a new poly-Hema coated petri dish. Medium containing FGF should not be stored longer than 1 week at 4°C. During the first two weeks, the medium should be removed using a 1000 µL pipet to keep the accidental removal of small spheres to a minimum. In addition, removed medium should be kept in a new petri dish under culture conditions until the next feeding day, to transfer accidentally removed spheres back to the culture. The neurospheres should be well distributed in the petri dish to prevent aggregation. This is especially important after mechanical dissociations. It is important to avoid frequent re-opening of the incubators, to ensure constant CO2 and temperature levels. Furthermore, the smallest vibrations can lead to aggregations of neurospheres.",Medium,"The answer provides some relevant information about variability in initial cells, critical consumables, and handling steps, such as the importance of EGF and FGF, and handling procedures to prevent cell attachment. However, it lacks comprehensive coverage of all aspects mentioned in the question, such as specific recommendations for genetically-modified cells, microphysiological systems, and detailed batch effects. The answer could be more complete by addressing these additional factors and providing more specific recommendations for reproducibility and performance.","Based on the information provided in NPC2‑5.pdf, the following factors contribute to variability in the source cells and test system:

• Variability from the source itself: Different donors yield neurospheres that vary in size at thawing and in proliferative capacity. The initial sphere size and growth rate may differ depending on donor and gestational age, leading to heterogeneity in the source cell population. (Source: NPC2‑5.pdf, “Variability and troubleshooting of source cells”)

• Critical consumables and batch effects:  
 – The proliferation medium is serum‑free; however, the use of growth factors is critical. In particular, recombinant human FGF—which is supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin—can show batch‑to‑batch variability.  
 – The coated surfaces (e.g., poly‑D‑lysine/laminin for the assay and poly‑HEMA for suspension during expansion) are also critical; their quality and format (e.g., 96‑well plate type, consistency of coating) can influence cell attachment, migration, and differentiation.  
 – Although not directly mentioned in the NPC2‑5 protocol, other assays note that reagents such as fetal calf serum (FCS) or serum replacement, and key additives (e.g., the type of trypsin or form of transferrin) may contribute to variability; similar principles would apply when transitioning to or using genetically modified cells or microphysiological systems, where matrix chemistry and geometry become even more critical. (Source: NPC2‑5.pdf, “Critical consumables”)

• Critical handling steps and influencing factors:  
 – The thawing process is critical because the thawing medium contains DMSO. Cells need to be quickly diluted in prewarmed proliferation medium to minimize DMSO’s effects on cell health. Adding FGF immediately before thawing further minimizes any negative batch or handling effects.  
 – Careful, consistent pipetting is crucial (for example, during media change steps with a 1000‑µL pipet) to avoid accidental removal or aggregation of small neurospheres.  
 – During the early culture phase, careful handling is needed to maintain even neurosphere distribution; for instance, transferring spheres from petri dishes to prevent repeated attachment after mechanical dissociation.  
 – In genetically modified cells or microphysiological systems, in addition to the points above, additional attention is needed to matrix properties (chemistry and geometry), the possible influence of microfluidics on cell distribution (surface vs. core cells), and the matching of handling procedures to ensure uniform cell exposure. (Source: NPC2‑5.pdf, “Critical handling”)

Recommendations to increase reproducibility and performance include:  
 – Use automated liquid handling systems for coating, feeding, and compound dispensing to minimize pipetting errors and reduce user bias.  
 – Strictly follow the SOP for cell expansion, plating, and feeding to ensure consistent sphere size selection and cell density.  
 – Regularly monitor the quality and performance of critical reagents such as growth factors (EGF, FGF), checking each batch for performance differences.  
 – Optimize plate preparation (using consistent suppliers and plate formats) and use appropriate controls (e.g., poly‑HEMA-coated dishes for suspension culture and standardized coated assay plates) to ensure uniform cell attachment and migration conditions.  
 – For genetically modified systems or microphysiological setups, carefully control matrix properties and consider adjustments in the microfluidic design to maintain equal exposure of cells across the culture area.  

By addressing these factors, one can reduce the inter‐ and intra‐experimental variability and thereby increase the overall reproducibility and performance of the assay. (Sources: NPC2‑5.pdf)",0.7056185155825784,0.15677037835121155,-0.01511481311172247,0.0681426003575325

The medium contains Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium and Hams F12 (2:1) supplemented with 2% B27, 20 ng/mL EGF, 20 ng/mL recombinant human FGF, 1% penicillin and streptomycin. The thawing is performed by repeated addition and removal of proliferation medium to the vial until all cells are transferred to a tissue culture flask containing proliferation medium. The cells are carefully resuspended and distributed to 10 cm petri dishes filled with fresh, prewarmed proliferation medium. The cells are fed by replacing half the medium with new medium every two to three days (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). At each feeding day, the culture is checked for impurities (e.g. fibers or other debris). Impurities and the removed media are transferred to a new petri dish (waste dish). If spheres are mistakenly sorted out during feeding, they can be rescued and placed back in the original culture dish. After 3-4 weeks neurospheres reach the acceptable size of 0.2 – 0.5 mm for passaging by mechanical dissociation. Therefore, neurospheres are mechanically dissociated into pieces of 0.15 - 0.25 mm edge length (depending on the desired sphere size after passaging) using a tissue chopper, which then round-off again to uniform sized neurospheres within 1 day in proliferation medium. By using this method, neurospheres are expanded every week. Starting at week three poly-Hema-coated dishes are used for the cultivation procedure. Figure 8 differentiation towards the final test system. hNPC are thawed by repeated addition and removal of proliferation media. The resuspended cells are distributed to cell culture dishes and cultivated in proliferation media containing EGF and FGF for three to four weeks with 50% media exchange every two to three days.

The answer is partially complete but lacks clarity and completeness in addressing all aspects of the question.","The assay differentiates human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) by first expanding them as free‐floating, self‐organized 3D neurospheres that are later plated on an adhesion-promoting substrate to induce migration and differentiation. The overall scheme is as follows (Sources: NPC2-5.pdf):

1. Preparation and Expansion:
 • hNPCs are received as cryopreserved 3D neurospheres. They are thawed by repeatedly adding and removing prewarmed proliferation medium.
 • The cells are then distributed into 10‑cm petri dishes containing proliferation medium (a mix of DMEM and Ham’s F12 supplemented with 2% B27, 20 ng/mL EGF, 20 ng/mL recombinant human FGF, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin).
 • During a 3- to 4‑week expansion period, the spheres grow and are passaged weekly by mechanical dissociation (using a tissue chopper) into uniform neurospheres. During this period the cultures are kept in poly‑HEMA–coated petri dishes to prevent unwanted cell attachment and aggregation.

2. Differentiation – Plating and Initiation:
 • Once neurospheres reach a defined size (typically 0.25–0.35 mm in diameter, with 0.3 mm used as the standard), a single sphere is plated in each well of a 96‑well, flat-bottom plate.
 • The plates are pre-coated with poly‑D‑lysine/laminin to promote cell attachment and to simulate extracellular matrix interactions.
 • At plating, the culture medium is switched from the proliferation medium to a differentiation medium. This medium is based on DMEM and Ham’s F12 (in a 2:1 ratio) supplemented with 1% N2 and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
 • The plated sphere initially sits at the center of the well, which allows a symmetrical, radial migration pattern.

3. Culture Manipulations and Time Course:
 • Immediately after plating, the spheres are allowed to settle and equilibrate (typically 15–30 minutes at 37°C with 5% CO₂).
 • Migratory and differentiation processes then initiate immediately—hNPCs start migrating radially from the sphere core onto the coated substrate.
 • A scheduled medium change is performed on day 3 (72 hours) of differentiation. Here, 50% of the medium is removed and replaced with fresh differentiation medium (which can also include any test compounds).
 • The total duration of the differentiation and migration phase is 5 days (120 hours). During this period, the cells differentiate into various neural lineages (radial glia, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes) while migrating outward.

4. Graphical/Schematic Overview and Special Considerations:
 • Graphical representations (e.g. Figure 8 “differentiation towards the final test system” and Figure 9 “Exposure scheme” in the document) show the procedure: starting from a rounded neurosphere in the center of a well, cells spread out radially on the poly‑D‑lysine/laminin matrix.
 • The well-defined size and shape of the neurospheres are critical because only spheres within the 0.25–0.35 mm range are acceptable.
 • Since the differentiation relies on self-organization and cell–matrix interactions, uniform sphere size and uniform coating are essential. This guarantees reproducible radial migration and differentiation.
 • For microphysiological systems and organoid-like assays, additional requirements such as controlled aggregation, geometrical characterization (sphericity, diameter), and precise medium handling (especially during medium changes) are key to maintaining the integrity of the self-organized tissue structure (as applied here via a standardized plating and medium exchange protocol).

In summary, the protocol moves from a phase of controlled proliferation and self-assembly in suspension (with mechanical passaging in poly‑HEMA dishes) to a phase of adhesion-induced differentiation on a defined extracellular matrix (poly‑D‑lysine/laminin), with scheduled medium replacement and strict size criteria to ensure uniform radial migration and differentiation in a 96‑well plate format. This supports both the self-organization of the neurospheres and the reliable measurement of migration and neural differentiation endpoints.",0.8053875798817182,0.16351008415222168,-0.0009655787725932896,0.07914089411497116

It provides a reference to an SOP in a database format and mentions additional publications, but it lacks direct information on cell maintenance, purity, quality control, passage numbers, adherence to GCCP/GIVIMP, cell batch usage duration, preparation of frozen stocks, and characterization of primary cells. The answer is incomplete and lacks clarity on the specific points asked.","The complete SOP for basic cell maintenance (cell propagation) is provided as an SOP in DB‐ALM format (see Appendix J in Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). In short, primary hNPCs from Lonza (obtained as cryopreserved 3D neurospheres) are thawed and immediately expanded in a defined proliferation medium (a mix of DMEM/Ham’s F12 supplemented with 2% B27, 20 ng/mL EGF, 20 ng/mL FGF, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) at 37°C and 5% CO₂. The cells are plated in 10 cm dishes and fed every two to three days by replacing half of the medium, and—once the neurospheres reach approximately 0.2–0.5 mm in diameter (typically after 3–4 weeks)—they are mechanically dissociated for weekly passaging. Only spheres that are rounded and within 0.25–0.35 mm are accepted for further use in the test, ensuring a defined starting point for differentiation.

Quality control of the source cells includes several measures:  
• Before shipment, each vial is tested for sterility (confirmed HIV, HBV, HC negative; free of mycoplasma and bacteria)  
• The cells are provided at a defined cell count (approximately 1.2 × 10⁶ cells/mL) and a viability of ≥20%  
• Marker expression is verified by FACS (the proliferating neurospheres are shown to express neural stem cell markers such as nestin, SOX2, and Ki67; and after differentiation they are confirmed to be TUBB3- and GFAP-positive)  
• Spheres are also checked during maintenance for impurities and sphere size, with the acceptance criteria being that only spheres reaching the appropriate size range are used for experiments

Although the document does not state an explicit average purity percentage (e.g. “95% Oct4-positive”), the described characterization and acceptance criteria ensure that the cell population is well defined and consistent with neural progenitor identity. In addition, each new cell batch is further monitored for growth kinetics and response to key growth factors (EGF and FGF) to ensure reproducibility.

Regarding cell passage, the protocol indicates that after the initial mechanical dissociation there are no observable inter-individual differences. The cells are propagated weekly and spheres that have reached the acceptable size are used for experiments. (The document does not specify a strict “passage number” range; however, the expansion is typically done for 3–4 weeks before plating for differentiation.)  

The laboratory follows standard cell culture practices as outlined in the SOP and documented protocols. Although the text does not explicitly state “Good Cell Culture Practice (GCCP)” or “Good In Vitro Method Practice (GIVIMP),” the detailed documentation, quality control measures and training procedures (including a recommended four-week operator training period) indicate that best practices are followed.

Frozen stocks are prepared by cryopreserving the primary hNPC neurospheres in liquid nitrogen following thawing and expansion. The standard procedure involves rapid thawing (with repeated addition/removal of proliferation medium) followed by immediate dilution and controlled expansion. Once expanded, cells are frozen according to the SOP and stored as liquid nitrogen stocks. There is no fixed “expiration date” provided in the document; rather, the same cell batch is used during the expansion period (over a few weeks) and is monitored for consistency in sphere size and viability.  

For primary cells in general, the hNPCs used in this assay are obtained from commercial sources (Lonza). They are derived from human fetal cortex (gestational weeks 16–19) and, according to the supplier’s protocol, each donor material is pre-characterized by:  
• Its ability to express neural markers (nestin, SOX2, and Ki67 in proliferating neurospheres; TUBB3 and GFAP after differentiation)  
• Sterility testing (negative for HIV, HBV, HC, mycoplasma, and bacterial contamination)  
• A defined cell count and minimum viability (1.2×10⁶ cells/mL and ≥20% viability)  

Inclusion criteria thus require that the cells demonstrate expected marker profiles and sterility while exclusion criteria would include cells that do not achieve a sphere size of 0.2–0.5 mm, show reduced viability, or display contamination.

Between one to three days after passaging spheres at a size of 0.3 mm are used in the assay. For the assessment of neural progenitor cell migration and differentiation, the spheres are plated on poly-D-lysine/laminin coated 96-well flat bottom plates in differentiation medium (N2) to initiate migration and differentiation. Therefore, one sphere of 0.3 mm diameter is plated in the middle of a well. The differentiation medium consists of DMEM and Ham’s F12 at a ratio of 2 to 1 supplemented with 1% N2 and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Within 5 days NPCs radially migrate out of the sphere core and differentiate into radial glia cells (nestin positive), neurons (β-III-tubulin positive), oligodendrocytes (O4 positive) and astrocytes (GFAP positive). Cultivation during the test method is performed at 37°C and 5% CO2 at a pH of 7.2-7.6.",Medium,"The answer provides a detailed description of the culture protocol, including the medium composition and conditions for neural progenitor cell differentiation. However, it lacks information on the percentage of contaminating cells, the percentage of each subpopulation in co-cultures, and whether specific chemicals show differential cytotoxicity for the cell sub-populations used. These omissions prevent a 'High' score.","The test system comprises primary human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) isolated from fetal brain cortex (GW16–19) that are first expanded as three‐dimensional neurospheres in a serum‐free proliferation medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). During the expansion phase the cells are maintained in suspension (often on poly‑HEMA–coated dishes to prevent attachment) and are mechanically passaged once the spheres reach an acceptable size (typically 0.2–0.5 mm). After several weeks, neurospheres of uniform size (around 0.25–0.35 mm in diameter) are plated onto poly‑D‑lysine/laminin-coated 96‑well plates in a defined differentiation medium (DMEM/Ham’s F12, supplemented with 1% N2 and antibiotics). This plating initiates a differentiation process during which cells migrate radially from the sphere core and differentiate into multiple subpopulations—predominantly GFAP-positive radial glia (and astrocytes), with smaller fractions of β‑III‑tubulin positive neurons (acceptance criterion ≥1.5% after 5 days, around 20% have been reported) and O4-positive oligodendrocytes (acceptance criterion ≥1.5%, typically 1.5–11% of the cells) (Sources: NPC2-5.pdf, pp. 128–137).

Unlike methods that use collagen embedding or other more complex 3D scaffolds, this protocol uses a simple plating on an extracellular matrix (poly‑D‑lysine/laminin) to promote cell adhesion, migration, and subsequent differentiation. No additional agents like mitotic inhibitors or specific hormones beyond the defined growth factors are mentioned in the protocol.

Regarding cellular composition and sensitivity, the assay does not report any “contaminating” cells per se because the entire culture is derived from a self‐organized hNPC population. Instead, it is a mixed culture where the majority of cells are GFAP-positive radial glia/astrocytes, while neurons and oligodendrocytes constitute smaller subpopulations (meeting minimum percentages of 1.5% each). As a consequence, viability and cytotoxicity assays—which are based on measures of overall cell health (e.g. mitochondrial activity or membrane integrity)—tend to reflect the responses of the overrepresented radial glia/astrocyte population. This means that if certain chemicals or chemical classes were to differentially affect the less abundant neuronal or oligodendrocyte subpopulations, such effects might be less prominent in the overall viability readouts. At present the protocol does not provide detailed evidence that specific chemicals exhibit differential cytotoxicity across these subpopulations, and further studies would be needed to delineate such differences (Sources: NPC2-5.pdf, pp. 140–142).

In summary, the test system uses primary hNPC-derived neurospheres that undergo a simple yet well-defined differentiation protocol on extracellular matrix-coated plates. This allows modeling of key neurodevelopmental processes (including radial glia migration and neuronal/oligodendrocyte differentiation) while the mixed cell population—with a majority of radial glia/astrocytes—may influence viability outcomes if subpopulations respond differently to test compounds.",0.8041093443608541,0.23141872882843018,-0.013330886140465736,0.10001464933156967

1. Morphology/Size of Neurospheres – The neurospheres are inspected by bright‐field microscopy to verify that they are uniformly round and meet the size criterion. Only spheres with a diameter of 0.25–0.35 mm are accepted for the assay.  
  _(Source: NPC2-5.pdf)_

2. Marker Expression by Immunocytochemistry and FACS – Before differentiation, the cells are characterized by FACS to confirm the expression of neural stem/progenitor markers such as nestin, SOX2, and Ki67, and after differentiation they are checked for markers such as TUBB3 (neuronal) and GFAP (astrocytic). These marker profiles ensure that the cells are correctly specified.  
  _(Source: NPC2-5.pdf)_

3. Viability and Sterility – The source cell product from Lonza is provided with a viability of at least 20% and is tested to be free from microbial (bacterial, mycoplasma) and viral (HIV, HBV, HCV) contamination. These parameters are confirmed by routine sterility screening and regular visual inspections of the cultures.  
  _(Source: NPC2-5.pdf)_

4. Historical Performance and Reference Chemical Responses – Aside from these characterization endpoints, the assay is historically monitored by control responses. For instance, in each experiment, reference chemicals (such as PP2 for radial glia migration, EGF for neuronal differentiation and BMP7 for oligodendrocyte differentiation) are applied to ensure that the culture responds as expected. The data for control wells (e.g., migration distances or differentiation percentages) are recorded with defined acceptance ranges (for example, radial glia migration after 72 h should fall between 700 and 1500 µm, cell numbers between 2500 and 6000, and at least 1.5% neurons or oligodendrocytes in the migration area) based on hundreds of historical runs. If these values or other quality endpoints (e.g., abnormal morphology, reduced marker expression, low viability) deviate from the acceptance criteria, the culture is either discarded or the assay repeated.  
  _(Source: NPC2-5.pdf)_

In summary, the analytical methods used include bright-field imaging (with subsequent size measurements via ImageJ), immunocytochemistry combined with automated high-content imaging for marker quantification, FACS analysis for cell identity, sterility tests, and viability assays. The acceptance criteria require neurosphere roundness and size (0.25–0.35 mm), defined marker expression (e.g. positive staining for TUBB3 and GFAP upon differentiation, detection of nestin/SOX2/Ki67 in proliferating cells), a minimum viability of 20%, and a clean sterility profile. Historical controls consistently show these criteria within tight variation ranges; failure to meet them (e.g. significantly lower viability, abnormal morphology, reduced or inconsistent marker expression) prompts exclusion of that batch and repetition of the culture preparation.

For this process the following acceptance criteria are defined for the solvent control (SC; median of at least three replictes): Radial glia migration 72h: 700 – 1500 µm; Radial glia migration 120h: 700 – 1600 µm; Cell number: 2500 – 6000; Percentage of neurons ≥ 1.5 %; Percentage of Oligodendrocytes ≥ 1.5 %,Medium,"The answer provides specific acceptance criteria for radial glia migration and cell number, as well as percentages for neurons and oligodendrocytes. However, it lacks information on historical controls, average and variation of values, and actions if acceptance criteria are not met. The response is partially complete but lacks clarity and detail in some areas.","The test system is accepted only when several key quality criteria are met. For example, before starting the experiment the neurospheres must be rounded and have a diameter between 0.25 and 0.35 mm. Once plated and differentiated, the solvent control values (based on the median of at least three replicates) need to fall within defined ranges. Specific endpoints include:

• Radial glia migration: After 72 hours, migration distances should be between 700 and 1500 µm, and after 120 hours between 700 and 1600 µm.  
• Cell number: The total number of cells present in the migration area should be between 2500 and 6000.  
• Neuronal differentiation: At least 1.5% of the cells in the migration area need to be positive for neuronal markers (β‑III‑tubulin).  
• Oligodendrocyte differentiation: Similarly, a minimum of 1.5% of the cells need to be oligodendrocyte-positive (O4).

Historically, the test system has been run in over 40 experiments and the endpoints have shown good reproducibility, with variability (coefficients of variation) for key endpoints—for instance, intra‑experimental variation for radial glia migration at 72 h is around 5.1 ± 1.9% and inter‑experimental variation (after normalization to a low concentration) is in the low single digits to around 6% for migration endpoints. In our routine practice, if an experiment’s negative (solvent) controls fail to reach these acceptance ranges (for example, if the migration distance or cell numbers fall significantly below the stated ranges, or if neuronal or oligodendrocyte differentiation is below 1.5%), the experiment is not considered valid and the data are discarded. In such cases, the assay is repeated. 

These defined acceptance criteria ensure that the cells are healthy, sufficiently differentiated, and migrating properly so that any compound‐related effects can be reliably interpreted.

Primary hNPCs are a complex multicellular system with a self-organized sphere composition as well as migration and differentiation. Due to the complex multicellular and self-organizing nature, the test system is subject to some heterogenicity which is represented as biological variability of some of the measured endpoints. The variability for the different endpoints is shown in 8.4 “Test Performance”.",Low,"The answer does not adequately address the question. It mentions sources of variation related to sphere selection and biological variability but fails to provide details on critical consumables, batch effects, handling steps, controls, expected values, or recommendations for reproducibility and performance.","Below is a summary of variability‐causing factors and key recommendations extracted from the document:

1. Known Causes of Variability and Critical Consumables/Batch Effects  
 • Sphere size differences may arise due to differences in donor material and during mechanical dissociation. (Source: NPC2-5.pdf, “Variability and troubleshooting of source cells”)  
 • Critical reagents include EGF and recombinant human FGF. In particular, the FGF used contains 1% bovine serum albumin, which is subject to batch‐to‐batch variability. (Source: NPC2-5.pdf, “Critical consumables”)  
 • The proliferation medium does not contain serum or its replacements; therefore, any lot‐to‐lot variation in additives (or other supplements) may also affect the assay outcome.  
 • The plate format and coating are critical. Plates must be poly-D-lysine/laminin coated, and outer wells should be filled with water to prevent edge effects. (Source: NPC2-5.pdf, “Handling details of the test method”)

2. Critical Handling Steps and Influencing Technical Factors  
 • Thawing: The thawing medium contains DMSO, which can negatively affect cell health; cells must be quickly diluted in prewarmed proliferation medium. (Source: NPC2-5.pdf, “Critical handling”)  
 • Pipetting: Accurate pipetting is essential at several steps (e.g., coating, medium exchange, compound additions). Pipetting errors lead directly to variability in cell number, viability, and readout endpoints. (Source: NPC2-5.pdf, “Handling details of the test method”)  
 • Mechanical dissociation and sphere selection: Consistency in sphere size (acceptability: 0.25–0.35 mm) is required; differences in picking spheres or mechanical dissociation can induce variability in migration and differentiation outcomes. (Source: NPC2-5.pdf, “Acceptance criteria for assessing the test system at its start”)

3. Positive/Negative Controls and Their Expected Values  
 • Positive Controls:  
  – Radial glia migration (NPC2a): The SRC kinase inhibitor PP2 (10 µM) is used, which should reduce migration to between 0 and 60% of the solvent control.  
  – Neuronal differentiation (NPC3): EGF (20 ng/mL) is the positive control, exerting a reduction of neuronal differentiation to 0–50% of the SC.  
  – Oligodendrocyte differentiation (NPC5): BMP7 (100 ng/mL) is used, reducing differentiation to approximately 0–60% compared to the solvent control.  
 • Negative Controls:  
  – Solvent controls (e.g., DMSO 0.1% v/v, DPBS 2% v/v, ddH2O 2% v/v, MeOH 0.1% v/v) are run on each plate. These should mirror the media control response.  
 • Acceptance Criteria:  
  – For instance, the solvent control for radial glia migration 72 h should yield migration distances between 700 and 1500 µm, and the cell number in the migration area should be between 2500 and 6000.  
  – Each replicate in special cases (e.g., neuronal or oligodendrocyte migration) is expected to include at least 5 identifiable cells.  
  – Intra-experimental variation (CV) for positive controls ranges around 5–15% and inter-experimental variation (after normalization) shows similar tight ranges for several endpoints. (Source: NPC2-5.pdf, “Endpoint-specific controls” and “Test Performance”)

4. Recommendations to Increase/Ensure Reproducibility and Performance  
 • Use automated liquid handling systems to minimize pipetting errors, particularly for plate coating, feeding, and compound dilutions. (Source: NPC2-5.pdf, “Handling details of the test method”)  
 • Standardize sphere selection by using strict size criteria and monitoring donor-to-donor variability.  
 • Ensure reagents (especially FGF and other additives) are from the same batch if possible, or validate new batches against historical performance.  
 • Store coated plates at 4°C for no longer than 7 days and minimize incubator door-opening to maintain constant temperature and CO₂ levels.  
 • Maintain careful documentation with AXES sheets to track technical deviations and ensure traceability of cell source, cell passage, and compound dilutions.  
 • Fill outer wells with H₂O to avoid edge effects and ensure even distribution of neurospheres across the plate.  
 • For critical steps such as thawing and mechanical dissociation, perform quickly and uniformly to preserve cell health and consistency. (Sources: NPC2-5.pdf, “Critical handling”, “Handling details of the test method”, and “Day-to-day documentation of test execution”)

What specific information is there on transporter activity?,"Primary hNPCs under proliferating and differentiating conditions do not express CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 (Gassmann et al., 2010). Primary hNPCs during differentiation, have the capacity to up-regulate glutathione-dependent protective strategies upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) exposure (Masjosthusmann et al, 2019). Gene expression levels of genes involved in the antioxidative defense (glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), catalase (CAT)) were comparable between the in vitro system and developing human brains in vivo and show similar expression levels (Masjosthusmann et al., 2019).

Give information on where the test system differs from the mimicked human tissue and which gaps of analogy need to be considered.,"hNPCs reflect the following in vivo tissue features: In differentiation culture: NPC2a – radial glia cell migration → corresponding to radial glia cell migration during corticogenesis in vivo. The migrated hNPCs exhibit the characteristic elongated radial glia (RG)-like morphology and express the RG-markers nestin and GFAP as well as the proliferation marker Ki-67 (Koch et al., 2022). In accordance with in vivo studies, exposure to EGF (0.5-1 ng/mL) after neurosphere plating enhances hNPC migration compared to the solvent control (Koch et al., 2022). As a second human-relevant key regulator of migration, hNPCs respond to SRC-family kinase inhibition (PP2) with reduced migration (Moors et al., 2007; Koch et al., 2022). The migration speed of hNPCs in vitro is in the same range as migrating mouse granule cells in vivo (Baumann et al., 2016, Fahrion et al., 2012). NPC2b – migration of young cortical neurons on radial glia scaffolds → corresponding to cortical neuronal radial migration. NPC2c – oligodendrocyte migration → corresponding to oligodendrocyte migration during corticogenesis. NPC3 – fetal neuronal differentiation into young neurons → corresponding to cortical neurogenesis in vivo. Over the time course of differentiation, neurons expressing β-III-tubulin progressively appear in the migration zone representing approximately 20% of the mixed culture after 5 days. In line with observations in vivo, inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway during hNPC differentiation increases neuronal numbers compared to the solvent control (Koch et al., 2022). Moreover, narciclasine, an activator of Ras homolog family member A (RhoA), reduces neuronal differentiation of hNPCs cultured for 5 days in a concentration-dependent manner (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020; Blum et al., 2023). Likewise, RhoA inactivation stimulated axon regeneration and recovery of hindlimb function after spinal cord injury in mice (Dergham et al., 2002). NPC4 – neurite length, neurite area of young primary fetal neurons → corresponding to axon/dendrite formation in vivo. During the 5 days of hNPC differentiation, neurite maturation is characterized by an elongation of neurites and an increase in neurite area (Koch et al., 2022). Increase in RhoA activity caused morphological alterations in rat cortical neurons in vivo (Chen et al., 2018). In line with that, RhoA activator narciclasine reduced both neurite area and neurite length (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020). NPC5 – oligodendrocyte formation from fetal hNPCs → corresponding to oligodendrogenesis during the fetal phase of brain development. Differentiation of hNPCs over 5 days progressively generates cells expressing the oligodendrocyte-marker O4, which exhibit the typical oligodendrocyte morphology with multiple branched processes necessary to ensheath neuronal axons (Moors et al., 2009; Koch et al., 2022). Differentiation of hNPCs in the presence of the Notch inhibitor DAPT concentration-dependently decreases the percentage of O4-positive cells compared to the solvent control (Koch et al., 2022). Moreover, oligodendrocyte differentiation is negatively influenced by bone morphogenic protein (BMP) 7 (Baumann et al., 2015) and BMP2 (Masjosthusmann et al., 2018), proteins of the transforming growth factor β family. These data demonstrate that two major developmental pathways, i.e. Notch and BMP, are functional in hNPCs. Primary hNPCs are self-organized and produce auto- and paracrine cues like heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) and neuregulins that guide migration and differentiation. Moreover, they express extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins like laminin subunits, fibronectin and collagens (microarray data from Klose et al. 2021). Hence, effects concerning ECM-like adhesion defects can be assessed with this assay (Barenys et al. 2017). Various signaling cues that guide migration and differentiation processes of the neurosphere assay are summarized in Koch et al., 2022.",Low,"The answer provides detailed information on the features and behaviors of hNPCs in vitro, but it does not address where the test system differs from the mimicked human tissue or identify specific gaps of analogy that need to be considered. The response lacks a direct comparison between the test system and human tissue, which is essential to fully address the question.","The assay uses fetal human neural progenitor cells to recapitulate early neurodevelopmental events such as radial glia migration, neuronal and oligodendrocyte migration, and early differentiation events. However, several limitations arise when comparing the in vitro system to the full complexity of developing human brain tissue. Specifically:

• The cells represent early, fetal stages of brain development. Neurons remain immature, so later events (for example, synaptogenesis and the formation of functional neuronal networks) are not reproduced.  
• Although the assay mimics migration along radial glia, it does not model proper positioning or cortical layer formation as seen in vivo.  
• Some key neurodevelopmental processes—such as neural proliferation, apoptosis, astrocyte maturation/reactivity, synaptogenesis, and network formation—are not included in the assay.  

These gaps illustrate that—while the assay gives valuable insight into early migration and differentiation—the full spectrum of later, more complex developmental processes cannot be addressed, which should be taken into account when extrapolating to human tissue responses.

Basic maintenance of the hNPCs is performed according to a standardized SOP that can be accessed in the DB‐ALM system. In summary, after thawing, the primary human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) are expanded in a serum‑free proliferation medium (DMEM/Ham’s F12 supplemented with B27, EGF, FGF, and antibiotics) at 37°C/5% CO₂. Cells are fed by replacing half the medium every two–three days and are weekly passaged by mechanical dissociation once the neurospheres reach the acceptable size (0.2–0.5 mm). This “basic cell propagation” is maintained throughout the expansion phase prior to plating for differentiation.

The purity of the cell population is ensured by supplier‐provided characterization and in‑house quality checks. Cryopreserved neurospheres from Lonza originate from the human fetal cortex (gestational weeks 16–19) and are characterized by expression of neural stem/progenitor markers (nestin, SOX2, Ki67) in proliferating cultures and, after differentiation, by markers such as TUBB3 (neurons), GFAP (astrocytes), and O4 (oligodendrocytes). Although a specific percentage is not reported in our protocol, the acceptance criteria for the source cells include positive immunocytochemical detection of TUBB3 and GFAP after differentiation, a cell count of approximately 1.2 × 10⁶ cells/mL, and a viability of at least 20%. Batch‐to‐batch testing also involves sterility controls (free of HIV, HBV, HC), mycoplasma testing (every three months), and routine visual inspections for fungal or bacterial contamination.

For use in the assay, cells are taken from the expanded cultures once neurospheres reach a defined size (0.25–0.35 mm) after 3–4 weeks of expansion. While the SOP does not strictly restrict passage number, the protocol implies that only early‐to‐mid passages (from the initial expansion) are used because any inter‐donor differences that may affect the downstream endpoints are minimized after the first mechanical dissociation. The entire cell expansion and maintenance procedure is performed under good cell culture practice (GCCP) conditions and the assay is in line with principles of Good In Vitro Method Practice (GIVIMP) as detailed in the SOP.

Regarding cell banking, once a sufficient number of neurospheres has been expanded, cells can be cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen to generate working cell banks. Freezing stocks are prepared by aliquoting 1 × 10⁶ cells per vial (using the supplier’s recommended protocol) and are stored at –20°C for short-term use or in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage. The same cell batch is typically used throughout an experimental series (up to four weeks in differentiation experiments), but prolonged cultures necessitate fresh thawing from the prepared cell bank in order to maintain reproducibility and cell quality.

For primary cells in general, the cells are obtained commercially (here, from Lonza) as cryopreserved 3D neurospheres isolated from the human fetal brain cortex. They are pre‐characterized by the supplier for cell identity (expression of neural progenitor markers), viability (minimum 20%), and sterility (free of HIV, HBV, HC, mycoplasma, and other contaminants). Inclusion criteria include an acceptable cell count (approx. 1.2 × 10⁶ cells/mL) and confirmed marker expression (e.g. nestin, SOX2, Ki67 in proliferating cultures, and proper differentiation marker expression after differentiation), while exclusion criteria are based on failure to meet these sterility and viability benchmarks.

──────────────────────────────
Overall Workflow

1. Neurosphere Expansion (3–4 weeks)  
 • Primary hNPCs are thawed and expanded as 3D neurospheres in proliferation medium containing EGF and FGF.  
 • Spheres are passaged weekly by mechanical dissociation until they reach an acceptable size (0.25–0.35 mm).  

2. Assay Setup and Plating (Day 0)  
 • Spheres are freshly selected (with a diameter around 0.3 mm) and re-plated onto 96‑well flat‐bottom plates pre‑coated with poly‑D‑lysine/laminin.  
 • The plating is done in differentiation medium (DMEM:Ham’s F12, 2:1) supplemented with 1% N2 and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.  
 • Test compounds (prepared by serial dilution in differentiation medium) or the solvent control are added to the wells simultaneously with the sphere plating.  
 • After a 15–30 minute equilibration period at 37°C/5% CO₂, the spheres become embedded in the medium, initiating migration and differentiation.

──────────────────────────────
Exposure Scheme Timeline

• Day 0 (Start of Differentiation / Exposure):  
 – Freshly re-plated neurosphere (0.3 mm diameter) is embedded on poly‑D‑lysine/laminin coated well.  
 – Differentiation medium with the test compound (or solvent control) is added.  
 – The assay begins with cells in a non-confluent, spheroid state.

        [Plating + Compound Exposure Day 0]

• 0–72 Hours (Initial Exposure Period):  
 – Spheres remain in the differentiation medium with the test compound continuously present.  
 – During this period, cells initiate radial migration out of the sphere core.

• 72 Hours (Medium Change & Re-dosing):  
 – Half of the medium from each well is carefully removed and replaced with freshly prepared differentiation medium containing the same concentration of the test compound (or solvent control).  
 – This step ensures that compound exposure is maintained and that the cells receive fresh nutrients.

        [Medium Change/Re-dosing at 72h]

• 72–120 Hours (Continued Exposure & Differentiation):  
 – The migration process continues, now in the refreshed medium.  
 – Cells further differentiate into neurons, oligodendrocytes, radial glia, etc.

• 120 Hours (End of Exposure):  
 – The assay is terminated.  
 – Endpoints are assessed:  
  • Brightfield imaging is used (e.g., for radial glia migration measured at 72 h and 120 h).  
  • The wells are fixed and immunocytochemistry (using Hoechst, β‑III‑tubulin and O4 staining) is performed to quantify neuronal and oligodendrocyte differentiation, neurite outgrowth, and other endpoints.

──────────────────────────────
Key Critical Points

• Cells used in the assay are freshly re-plated spheres rather than a confluent monolayer.  
• Coating: Plates must be pre‑coated with poly‑D‑lysine/laminin to provide the appropriate extracellular matrix for migration.  
• Differentiation medium is critical—it does not include growth factors (EGF, FGF) but is supplemented with 1% N2 and penicillin/streptomycin.  
• Upon medium change at 72 h, compounds are re‑added in the fresh medium to maintain constant exposure conditions.  
• Timing of medium change and strict re‑addition of compounds ensure that the developing cells remain exposed to defined doses while receiving fresh nutrients.

The response is detailed and covers all aspects of the question, including the primary and secondary endpoints and normalization methods.","Primary endpoints of the NPC2-5 assay are the neurodevelopment‐specific measures, which include:

• Radial glia migration (measured at both 72 hours and 120 hours as the migration distance in µm from the sphere core)  
• Neuronal migration, defined as the mean distance of all neurons from the sphere core after 120 hours  
• Oligodendrocyte migration, defined similarly for oligodendrocytes  
• Neuronal differentiation, determined as the percentage of β‑III-tubulin–positive neurons among all cells (Hoechst‐positive nuclei) after 120 hours  
• Neurite outgrowth parameters (neurite length and neurite area) assessed after 120 hours  
• Oligodendrocyte differentiation, based on the percentage of O4‑positive cells after 120 hours  

Cytotoxicity is not the primary endpoint; it is measured as a secondary endpoint together with cell viability. Secondary endpoints include:

• Cell number (total count of Hoechst-positive nuclei)  
• Cytotoxicity (assessed via LDH release assays at 72 and 120 hours)  
• Viability (determined via mitochondrial activity using a resazurin reduction assay at 120 hours)

For normalization of the primary endpoints, the test system uses reference endpoints such as the cell number. In practice, neuronal and oligodendrocyte differentiation endpoints are expressed as a percentage relative to the total cell number measured in the migration area (using Hoechst-staining). In addition, cytotoxicity and viability data serve as unspecific endpoints that help distinguish specific developmental effects from general cell health impairment.

Provide here a general overview of the method’s key steps (e.g. cells are fixed or not, homogenized sample or not, etc.), sufficient for reviewers/regulators to understand what was done, but not in all detail for direct repetition. If you have two or more endpoints (e.g. viability and neurite outgrowth), do you measure both in the same well, under same conditions in parallel, or independently of each other? For imaging endpoints: Explain in general how quantification algorithm or how semi-quantitative estimates are obtained and how many cells are imaged (roughly).","Primary endpoints: 1 . Radial glia migration 72 h is assessed as migration distance in µm from the edge of the sphere core to the edge of the migration area based on brightfield images of each well (Figure 3). Therefore, each plate is scanned after 72 h in culture in an automated high content imaging device under 5% CO2 and 37°C. Images are exported and the sphere size in four directions is measured manually using ImageJ. All other primary endpoints are assessed based on an ICC staining image for each sphere. Therefore, cells are fixated after 120 h in culture and an ICC staining with Hoechst for nuclei, β-III-tubulin for neurons and O4 for oligodendrocytes is performed. The plates are scanned using an automated high content imaging device and all nuclei and their positions are determined automatically based on their intensity and size. Images are imported to the Omnisphero software (https://omnisphero.com) to run the image analysis that measures the following endpoints. 2 . Radial glia migration 120h is assessed as the migration distance in µm between the sphere core and the edge of the migration area based on ICC images of Hoechst-positive nuclei. By identification of each nuclei’s position in relation to the sphere core, the migration distance can be calculated. Therefore, a density distribution mask is calculated. By scanning the images of the nuclei channel, the algorithm can determine relatively more or less dense image areas. By identifying the densest area in the image, the sphere core can be detected. For identification of the migration, it is assumed, that the nuclei density decreases with increasing distance to the sphere core. Once the density hits a pre-defined threshold, the outer boundaries are determined and the sphere itself can be mapped out in a polynomial bounding box. Derived from this box, the actual size and migration distance can be calculated for each well. 3 . Neuronal migration 120 h is the mean distance of all neurons from the edge of the sphere core in relation to the radial glia migration and is determined based on the position of each neuron (see neuronal differentiation). 4 . Oligodendrocyte migration 120 h is the mean distance of all oligodendrocytes from the edge of the sphere core in relation to the radial glia migration and is determined based on the position of each oligodendrocytes (see oligodendrocyte differentiation). 5 . Neuronal differentiation is defined as the number of all β-III-tubulin-positive cells in percent of the cell number (Hoechst-positive cells) in the migration area after 120 h of differentiation. The identification of neurons is done automatically using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Training of the CNN was done based on manually annotated experiments (Förster et al., 2021). 6 . Neurite length 120 h is the mean length in µm of all neurons (see neuronal differentiation) that are identified by the skeletonization algorithm in Omnisphero (https://omnisphero.com). 7 . Neurite area 120 h is the mean area in pixels (without nuclei) of all neurons (see neuronal differentiation) that are identified by the skeletonization algorithm in Omnisphero (https://omnisphero.com). 8 . Oligodendrocyte differentiation 120 h is defined as the number of all O4-positive cells in percent of the cell number (Hoechst-positive cells) within the migration area after 120 h of differentiation. The identification of oligodendrocytes is done automatically using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Training of the CNN was done based on manually annotated experiments (Förster et al., 2021). Secondary endpoints: 3 . Cell number is the number of all Hoechst-positive nuclei detected within the area between the sphere core and the outer boundaries of the migration area (see radial glia migration 120 h). 4 . Cytotoxicity 72/120 h is assessed as membrane integrity by measuring the amount of LDH leaked from cells with damaged plasma membranes. LDH-dependent reduction of resazurin to resorufin is measured in the supernatant of each well as fluorescence of the reaction product resorufin (relative fluorescence unit) in a multiplate reader after 72/120 h of differentiation and compound treatment. 5 . Viability 120 h is assessed as mitochondrial activity by measuring the amount of resazurin reduced to fluorescent resorufin (relative fluorescence unit) in a multiplate reader in the last two hours of the 120 h differentiation and compound treatment period.",High,"The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the analytical methods used, detailing the key steps and principles involved in assessing various endpoints. It describes the imaging techniques, quantification algorithms, and conditions under which measurements are taken. The explanation includes how different endpoints are measured, the use of automated imaging devices, and the software employed for analysis. The response is relevant, complete, and sufficient for reviewers to understand the methods without needing full procedural details.","The NPC2‐5 assay combines imaging‐based quantification with biochemical measurements in a single 96‐well experiment. In brief, after plating 0.3‐mm hNPC spheres on poly‑D‑lysine/laminin‐coated plates in differentiation medium, cells are allowed to migrate and differentiate. For live cell migration analysis at 72 hours, brightfield images are acquired and migration is manually measured (in four directions) using ImageJ. At 120 hours, the cells are fixed and immunostained for Hoechst (nuclei), β‑III‑tubulin (neurons), and O4 (oligodendrocytes). An automated high‐content imaging device captures these ICC images, and a software tool (Omnisphero) is used to quantify endpoints such as migration distance (by segmenting the sphere core via a density mask), cell numbers, neuronal differentiation (percentage of β‑III‑tubulin‑positive cells), neurite length and area (using skeletonization algorithms), and oligodendrocyte differentiation. In parallel, biochemical endpoints (cell viability and cytotoxicity) are measured in the same well using complementary assays (e.g. resazurin reduction and LDH release assays). This parallel assessment ensures that all endpoints—from morphological and differentiation markers to viability—are derived under identical culture conditions and from each individual sphere. Typically, the imaging setup captures hundreds to several thousand Hoechst‐positive nuclei per well, providing robust statistics for each endpoint. _(Source: NPC2-5.pdf)_",0.7719138704229439,-0.041601553559303284,0.07027819007635117,0.015405029989778996
"Provide information on machine settings, analytical standards, data processing and normalization procedures. For imaging endpoints: provide detailed algorithm. This information should also be covered in an SOP, preferably in DB-ALM format (see link in 6.6).",All technical details for the test method are available in the SOP in DB-ALM format (Appendix J in Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). Detailed protocols are also available as publications (Baumann et al. 2014; Nimtz et al. 2019) or upon request (ellen.fritsche@iuf-duesseldorf.de).,Medium,"The answer references the availability of technical details in an SOP and publications, which partially addresses the question. However, it lacks specific information on machine settings, analytical standards, data processing, normalization procedures, and detailed algorithms for imaging endpoints. The answer is not fully self-contained and requires external documents for complete information.","The assay’s imaging‐based endpoints are acquired and analyzed with an automated high‐content imaging system that is maintained at 37°C and 5% CO₂. This imaging device is used to scan 96‐well plates containing fixed, ICC‐stained spheres. Detailed information on instrument settings (e.g., temperature, CO₂ conditions, plate format) and pipetting/plate‐handling steps are specified in the test method SOP in DB‐ALM format (see Appendix J in Masjosthusmann et al. 2020) _(Source: NPC2-5.pdf)_.

For analytical standards, each plate includes endpoint‐specific controls: for example, PP2 for radial glia migration (NPC2a), EGF for neuronal differentiation (NPC3), and BMP7 for oligodendrocyte differentiation (NPC5). These controls are run with four replicates per plate and serve to normalize the test compound’s effects against a well‐defined solvent control condition (e.g. 0.1% DMSO) _(Source: NPC2-5.pdf)_.

Data processing and normalization procedures are carried out using a dedicated R‐based evaluation tool. Raw image data acquired by the high‐content imager are imported into the Omnisphero software (https://omnisphero.com). For example:  
• Radial glia migration at 72 h is measured manually in ImageJ (by measuring the sphere size in four directions) and then the mean of four replicate measures is directly entered into the AXES sheet.  
• For endpoints assessed from ICC images (radial migration at 120 h, cell number, differentiation, neurite length/area), the Omnisphero software automatically detects all Hoechst‐positive nuclei as well as marker‐positive neurons (β‑III‑tubulin) and oligodendrocytes (O4) using a convolutional neural network that was trained on manually annotated images _(Förster et al., 2021)_.  
• Neuronal differentiation is calculated as the number of β‑III‑tubulin‐positive neurons divided by the number of all Hoechst‑positive cells (multiplied by 100 for percentage). Other endpoints such as neuronal or oligodendrocyte migration are normalized to the radial glia migration distance.  
• Viability is determined by correcting the measured signal (e.g. Alamar blue assay fluorescence) for medium background, and cytotoxicity is normalized using the formula:  
  normalized response = (lysis control – response) / (lysis control – solvent control)  
• For each experiment, replicate data points are normalized to the median solvent control response to account for inter‐plate variability, and then pooled for curve fitting (using the R package drc) to determine Benchmark Concentrations (BMCs) and their confidence intervals (BMCU and BMCL) _(Source: NPC2-5.pdf)_.

Detailed algorithm for imaging endpoints in Omnisphero is as follows:  
1. Images are acquired in both brightfield and fluorescence channels (for Hoechst and cell‐type–specific markers).  
2. The software identifies nuclei by thresholding based on intensity and size. With these data, a density distribution mask is generated from the Hoechst channel.  
3. The densest region of nuclei is defined as the sphere core by fitting a polynomial bounding box around this area.  
4. Subsequently, the software determines the outer boundaries where nuclei density decreases below a pre‐defined threshold, thus delineating the migration area.  
5. Measurement algorithms then calculate:  
  a. The radial migration distance (from the sphere core to the outer edge).  
  b. The mean migration distances of neurons and oligodendrocytes based on the positions of individually identified marker‐positive cells.  
6. For neurite analysis, a skeletonization algorithm is applied on the β‑III‑tubulin–stained images to quantify neurite length (in µm or pixels) and area (in pixels, excluding nuclear regions).  

All these steps and settings are described in further detail in the SOP in DB‑ALM format (see Appendix J, Masjosthusmann et al., 2020). This ensures that machine settings, analytical standards, and data processing/normalization procedures are consistently applied and traceable throughout the assay workflow _(Sources: NPC2-5.pdf)_.

"MCC are chemicals/manipulations that show biologically plausible changes of the endpoint. List such controls (up to 10), indicate why you consider them as MCC, and describe expected data on such controls. Highlight the compounds to be used for testing day-to-day test performance, i.e. for setting acceptance criteria (AC). If available, indicate MCC that each increase or decrease the activity of the relevant pathway. Do pathway inhibitions or activations correlate with the test method response?","Primary Endpoints: All endpoint-specific controls are run on each experimental plate and for each human individual and passage number. Endpoint-specific control effects on NPC2a, NPC3 and NPC5 from n>40 experiments are shown in figure 4. The locations of the endpoint-specific controls on the experimental plate are shown in figure 5. 3. Radial glia migration 72 h: The endpoint-specific control for radial glia migration after 72 h is the SRC kinase inhibitor PP2. SRC family kinases represent one pathway that regulates radial glia migration of differentiating hNPCs (Moors et al., 2007). Inhibition of this pathway with PP2 (10 µM) causes a reduction of radial glia cell migration to values between 0 and 60 % of the solvent control. 4. Neuronal differentiation: The endpoint specific control for neuronal differentiation is EGF. EGF is a growth factor that stimulates radial glia proliferation and migration and inhibits neuronal differentiation (Ayuso-Sacido et al., 2010; Jenny Baumann et al., 2016). 20 ng/mL EGF reduces neuronal differentiation to values between 0 and 50% of the solvent control. 5. Oligodendrocyte differentiation: The endpoint specific control for oligodendrocyte differentiation is BMP7. BMP7 promotes the BMP signaling cascade which upregulates astroglia differentiation and maturation and inhibits oligodendrocyte formation (Jenny Baumann et al., 2016; Gross et al., 1996; Mabie et al., 1997). 100 ng/mL BMP7 reduces oligodendrocyte differentiation to values between 0 and 60 % of the SC. Figure 4: Effects of endpoint-specific positive controls. The SRC kinase inhibitor PP2 reduces radial glia migration (NPC2a), epidermal growth factor (EGF) reduces neuronal differentiation (NPC3) and bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP7) reduces oligodendrocyte differentiation (NPC5). Secondary Endpoints: 0.2 % Triton X-100 is used as a positive control for cell viability and cytotoxicity since it lyses the cell and therefore causes a maximal response for both endpoints. This positive control is run on each experimental plate (Figure 5).",Medium,"The answer provides some examples of MCCs and describes their effects on specific endpoints, but it lacks a comprehensive list of up to 10 controls and does not clearly indicate which compounds are used for setting acceptance criteria. Additionally, the correlation between pathway inhibitions or activations and the test method response is not explicitly addressed.","Below is a list of mechanistic control compounds (MCC) that have been used in the NPC2‐5 assay. These chemicals are considered MCC because they modify key neurodevelopmental endpoints by activating or inhibiting specific signaling pathways in a manner that is consistent with the biology underlying the assay. Their effects are reproducible and, when applied on every plate, they serve to monitor day‐to‐day test performance and help set the acceptance criteria (AC).

1. PP2 (10 µM)  
 • Role: A SRC‐family kinase inhibitor that targets the pathway regulating radial glia migration (endpoint NPC2a).  
 • Expected Response: Reduces radial glia migration to about 0–60% of solvent control values.  
 • Comment: Because inhibition of SRC kinases is known to reduce cell motility, PP2 is used routinely as a day‐to‐day control to confirm that the assay can detect a decrease in migration.  

2. EGF (20 ng/mL)  
 • Role: A growth factor acting via EGFR that affects several aspects of hNPC behavior. Although EGF stimulate proliferation and migration, its addition in this context is used as a control that leads to a decrease in neuronal differentiation (endpoint NPC3).  
 • Expected Response: Reduces neuronal differentiation to between 0 and 50% of the solvent control.  
 • Comment: Due to the biologically plausible antagonistic effect on neuronal differentiation, EGF is used on each plate to set the AC for this endpoint.  

3. BMP7 (100 ng/mL)  
 • Role: Activates the BMP signaling cascade known to promote astroglial differentiation while inhibiting oligodendrocyte formation (endpoint NPC5).  
 • Expected Response: Decreases oligodendrocyte differentiation to between 0 and 60% of the solvent control.  
 • Comment: BMP7 is run as a positive control for oligodendrocyte differentiation performance and is part of the routine quality control panel for this assay.  

4. Triton X‐100 (0.2% v/v)  
 • Role: A detergent that lyses cells and is used as a positive control for viability and cytotoxicity endpoints.  
 • Expected Response: Causes maximal release of LDH (cytotoxicity) and reduction in resazurin conversion (viability), ensuring that the assay is sensitive to changes in membrane integrity and mitochondrial activity.  

Additional MCC that have been reported and are informative in this assay system include:

5. DAPT (a Notch signaling inhibitor)  
 • Role: Inhibits Notch signaling, which has been shown to increase neuronal differentiation.  
 • Expected Response: An increase in the percentage of neuronal cells (β‐III-tubulin–positive) compared to controls.  
 • Comment: Although not routinely part of the day‐to‐day performance panel, DAPT is useful to demonstrate that modulation of the Notch pathway leads to expected changes in neuronal differentiation.

6. Narciclasine  
 • Role: Acts as a RhoA activator. Increased RhoA activity is known to reduce neurite outgrowth.  
 • Expected Response: A concentration‐dependent reduction in neurite length and neurite area (endpoint NPC4).  
 • Comment: This control further confirms that the assay is responsive to pathway activations that negatively impact neuronal morphology.

In summary, the pathway modulations do correlate with the test method responses. For example, inhibition of the SRC pathway by PP2 leads to reduced radial glia migration, whereas activation of the BMP pathway by BMP7 results in diminished oligodendrocyte differentiation. Similarly, the EGFR activation by EGF yields a decrease in neuronal differentiation, and inhibition of Notch signaling (via DAPT) increases the neuronal fraction. These responses are in line with our understanding of the underlying biology and are reproducible enough to serve as day‐to‐day controls for assay performance. Among these, PP2, EGF, and BMP7 are routinely used on every plate to confirm that the AC (e.g. migration distances, minimum percentages of neurons and oligodendrocytes) are met.

What chemicals/manipulations are used as positive controls? Describe the expected data on such controls (signal and its uncertainty)? How good are in vivo reference data on the positive controls? Are in vivo relevant threshold concentrations known?,"The NPC2-5 hNPC migration and differentiation assay correctly identified the following compounds that are known to cause DNT in humans or in vivo (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020; Blum et al., 2023): Methylmercury(II) chloride Cadmium chloride Hexachlorophene 2,2',4,4'-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether Dexamethasone Manganese(II) chloride Chlorpromazine hydrochloride Haloperidol Paraquat dichloride hydrate Trichlorfon Deltamethrin Sodium valproate Tebuconazole Tributyltin chloride Potassium perfluorooctanesulfonate",Low,"The answer lists chemicals used as positive controls but does not describe the expected data on these controls, such as signal and its uncertainty. It also does not address the quality of in vivo reference data or whether in vivo relevant threshold concentrations are known.","1. The assay uses the following endpoint‐specific positive controls:  
 • For radial glia migration (NPC2a), the SRC kinase inhibitor PP2 (10 µM) is applied. It is expected to reduce radial glia migration to between 0 and 60% of the solvent control.  
 • For neuronal differentiation (NPC3), EGF is used (at 20 ng/mL), which reduces neuronal differentiation to between 0 and 50% of the solvent control.  
 • For oligodendrocyte differentiation (NPC5), BMP7 is applied (at 100 ng/mL) and is expected to reduce differentiation to between 0 and 60% of the solvent control.  
Additionally, for the viability and cytotoxicity endpoints a positive control (0.2% Triton X‐100) is used to induce a maximal signal (i.e. full cell lysis).  
   
2. In terms of data quality, the positive controls provide a clear and robust signal as follows (CV values for positive controls are given as an indication of uncertainty across experiments):  
 – Radial glia migration 72 h: a reported inter‐experimental variation of about 15.5%  
 – Neuronal differentiation: an inter‐experimental variation of approximately 15.8%  
 – Oligodendrocyte differentiation: a variation of around 22.2%  
These figures, derived from Table 3 of the document, demonstrate that while there is some variability, the positive controls yield reproducible effects that are clearly separated from the solvent control signal.  
   
3. With respect to in vivo reference data for these positive controls, the document provides only limited data. Although aspects such as the migration speed of hNPCs in vitro are noted to be in the same range as migrating cells in vivo, the report does not offer robust in vivo threshold concentrations or well‐defined in vivo reference data for PP2, EGF, or BMP7. In fact, extrapolation parameters for in vitro–in vivo comparisons have not yet been determined.

"What chemicals/manipulations are used as negative controls? Describe the expected data on such controls (signal and its uncertainty)? (Such data define the background noise of the test method) What is the rationale for the concentration setting of negative controls? Do you use unspecific controls? If yes, indicate the compounds and the respective rationale for their use and the concentration selection.","The solvent control (SC) is used as negative control that is run on each experimental plate. Each SC has to be established by comparing the effect of the SC to the effect of the media control. Established solvent controls show the same response as the media control. The SC is used to assess if the acceptability criteria for radial glia migration, neuronal and oligodendrocyte differentiation are met and to normalize the compound treatment and the positive control response. Established solvent controls are: DMSO: 0.1 % v/v DPBS: 2 % v/v ddH2O: 2 % v/v MeOH: 0.1% v/v Other negative control compounds that were identified as negative in this assay and are known to not affect neurodevelopmental endpoints in vivo include (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020; Blum et al., 2023): Acetaminophen Amoxicillin Aspirin Buspirone Chlorpheniramine maleate D-Glucitol Diethylene glycol D-Mannitol Doxylamine succinate Famotidine Ibuprofen Metformin Metoprolol Penicillin VK Saccharin Sodium benzoate Warfarin",Medium,"The answer provides a list of chemicals used as negative controls and mentions the rationale for using solvent controls. However, it lacks details on the expected data (signal and its uncertainty) for these controls, the rationale for concentration settings, and whether unspecific controls are used. The answer is partially complete but lacks clarity and detail in some areas.","The negative control in the NPC2‑5 assay is the solvent control (SC). In practice, the SC is prepared by adding the pure solvent at the same concentration as present in the highest test condition. Commonly used solvents are:

• DMSO used at 0.1% v/v  
• DPBS at 2% v/v  
• ddH2O at 2% v/v  
• MeOH at 0.1% v/v  

These established solvent controls always yield a response that is essentially indistinguishable from a media‐only control. For example, responses in the SC must meet the predefined acceptance criteria (e.g. radial glia migration 72 h between 700–1500 µm, a cell number between 2500 and 6000, and ≥1.5% neurons and oligodendrocytes). The variability (background noise) is estimated from intra‐ and inter‐experimental variation as quantified in Table 3 (e.g. a CV of about 5–10% for migration endpoints). The rationale for setting the negative control concentration is that the final solvent concentration must be as high as required to deliver the compound (from the highest test concentration) while not affecting the biology of the test system.

In addition, unspecific (i.e. negative) control compounds that are known not to affect neurodevelopmental endpoints in vivo are also used. Compounds such as Acetaminophen, Amoxicillin, Aspirin, Buspirone, Chlorpheniramine maleate, D‑Glucitol, Diethylene glycol, D‑Mannitol, Doxylamine succinate, Famotidine, Ibuprofen, Metformin, Metoprolol, Penicillin VK, Saccharin, Sodium benzoate, and Warfarin have been identified to produce a “no effect” response on the endpoints. Their use reinforces that the assay is specific for DNT‐relevant effects and not confounded by non‐specific toxicity. These compounds are tested at concentrations that are both (a) soluble and (b) within the range where the solvent concentration (set according to the highest test compound concentration) does not produce biological effects.

"Does the test system have a particular apoptosis sensitivity or resistance? Is cytotoxicity hard to capture for minor cellular subpopulations? In multicellular systems, which cell population is the most sensitive? Are specific markers known for each cell population? Are there issues with distinguishing slowed proliferation from cell death? For repeated/prolonged dosing: Is early death and compensatory growth considered? For very short-term endpoints (e.g. electrophysiology measured 30 min after toxicant exposure): Is a delayed measure of cytotoxicity provided?","Differentiating hNPCs are a multicellular system consisting of radial glia, neurons (1.5-16 %), oligodendrocytes (1.5-11%) and astrocytes within the migration area. The measurement of cytotoxicity and viability therefore always represents all cells within the migration area. Because of the higher percentage of GFAP-positive radial glia and astrocytes, these two cell types are overrepresented in the assessment of cytotoxicity and viability. The measure of cell viability assessed by the Alamar blue assay (mitochondrial reductase activity) strongly depends on the number of cells in the migration area. Therefore, a reduction in cell number either due to a reduced migration distance or a lower cell number in the migration area will lead to a reduction in the Alamar blue signal despite the cell viability is not necessarily affected (Figure 3 in Nimtz et al. 2019). Therefore, as soon as the migration distance or cell number in the migration area are reduced, the Alamar blue (viability) assay is not used as a measure for viability, but the cytotoxicity assay (based on LDH release) is taken as a reference for the specific DNT endpoints to determine if the effect is specific or not.",Medium,"The answer provides some relevant information about the multicellular system and the challenges in measuring cytotoxicity and viability, particularly highlighting the overrepresentation of certain cell types and the limitations of the Alamar blue assay. However, it does not fully address all aspects of the question, such as specific apoptosis sensitivity or resistance, issues with distinguishing slowed proliferation from cell death, or considerations for repeated/prolonged dosing and short-term endpoints. The response lacks completeness and clarity on these points.","1. The test system does not specifically assess apoptosis. In fact, NPC apoptosis is listed among the neurodevelopmental processes that are not represented by this assay (see “Neurodevelopmental processes not represented by this test method,” page 154).  
2. Cytotoxicity endpoints (based on LDH release and Alamar blue viability) capture the overall response of all cells within the migration area. Because the culture is dominated by GFAP‐positive radial glia/astrocytes, subtle changes within small “minor” subpopulations (e.g. the neurons or oligodendrocytes) may be masked by the aggregate signal (see “Features relevant for cytotoxicity testing,” page 140).  
3. Concerning sensitivity, the viability and cytotoxicity readouts mostly reflect the dominant cell populations in the migration area – that is, the radial glia and astrocytes. There is no detailed analysis provided that specifically pinpoints one minor subpopulation as most sensitive over the others.  
4. For cell identification, the assay uses specific markers: neurons are identified by β‑III-tubulin; oligodendrocytes by O4; astrocytes by GFAP; and radial glia by nestin (and additionally GFAP and Ki‑67 for proliferative status) (see “Characterization and definition of source cells” and subsequent sections on cell differentiation, pages 127–133).  
5. The documentation stresses a known challenge: distinguishing between a reduction in cell number (which can result from either slowed migration/proliferation or from cell death) is not straightforward. For instance, a lower Alamar blue signal might occur due to fewer cells present as a consequence of reduced migration rather than actual loss of viability. Thus, when migration or cell count is reduced, the LDH‐based cytotoxicity measure is used as the reference endpoint (see “Features relevant for cytotoxicity testing,” page 140).  
6. Regarding repeated or prolonged dosing, the assay protocol involves compound exposure over 120 h with a feeding step after 72 h. There is no explicit procedure described that accounts for early cell death followed by compensatory growth over the exposure period.  
7. Finally, for very short-term endpoints such as electrophysiological measurements conducted 30 minutes after toxicant exposure, the assay does not include a provision for an early/delayed cytotoxicity measure; cytotoxicity and viability are assessed only at the 72 h and 120 h time points (see “Test method exposure scheme and endpoints,” pages 135–137).

Which rule do you apply to test whether a test run is within the normal performance frame? How do you document this decision? Indicate actions if the AC are not met.,General acceptance criteria (individual experiment): 3. At least three technical replicate values need to be present for each condition to be accepted for the 4. data analysis. At least five conditions need to be present for the experiment to be accepted in the data analysis for concentration response modeling. Endpoint dependent acceptance criteria: The acceptance criteria described below is the MEAN response of at least three replicates of the SC: − radial glia migration 72 h: 700 – 1500 µm − radial glia migration 120h: 700 – 1600 µm − neuronal differentiation: ≥1.5 % neurons − oligodendrocyte differentiation: ≥1.5 % oligodendrocytes − cell number: 2500 – 6000 The acceptance criteria described below is the response for each replicate and is applied to all conditions: 1 . neuronal migration: ≥ 5 neurons 2 . oligodendrocyte migration ≥ 5 oligodendrocytes,Medium,"The answer provides specific acceptance criteria for different endpoints, which partially addresses the question of how to determine if a test run is within the normal performance frame. However, it lacks clarity on how these criteria are documented and what specific actions are taken if the acceptance criteria are not met. The response is detailed in terms of criteria but incomplete regarding documentation and actions.","We use the predefined acceptance criteria (AC) specified in the protocol to decide whether a test run is “in‐spec.” For example, the solvent control responses for the primary endpoints must fall within the defined numerical ranges such as for radial glia migration (72 h: 700–1500 µm; 120 h: 700–1600 µm), cell number (2500–6000), and the minimum percentages for neuronal and oligodendrocyte differentiation (each ≥1.5%). In addition, the experiment must include the required number of conditions and technical replicates (e.g. at least three replicates per condition and at least five conditions overall). 

The decision to accept or reject the run is documented in the day‑to‑day test execution records, where all metadata (e.g. plate map, dates, operator, compound information) and raw data (including images and measured endpoints) are recorded in the Automated Experimental Evaluation (AXES) sheet. Any deviations or failures to meet the AC are noted in a comments section and the affected data points/wells are flagged. If the measured endpoints fall outside the acceptance ranges or the requirements (AC) are not met, then the run is not accepted for further analysis. In such cases, the affected wells are marked as outliers, troubleshooting is performed following the protocol’s detailed instructions, and the experiment is repeated to ensure data quality.

In the fully automated setup, 5 plates with 8 conditions (Figure 5) of 2 test compounds each and 4 replicates per condition can be run in one week by two technical assistants. This results in the generation of 320 data points for each endpoint within one week (excluding all controls). The throughput is therefore estimated as medium.",Low,"The answer does not address the specific question about 'real data points per month' or the possibility/extent of repeated measures from the same dish. It provides information about the setup and throughput in terms of data points per week, but does not convert this to a monthly estimate or discuss repeated measures, which are key components of the question.","Based on the throughput section of the document, the fully automated setup is described to run in one week 5 plates, each with 8 test conditions for 2 test compounds and 4 replicates per condition (with controls excluded). This yields 320 unique data points per endpoint per week. Assuming three working weeks per month, that translates to about 320 × 3 = 960 ""real"" data points per month (each unique compound concentration, with its replicates collapsed into one data point).

In addition, the assay protocol calls for measurements at more than one time point. For example, some endpoints (such as radial glia migration) are measured at 72 hours and then again at 120 hours after compound exposure. These measurements come from the same dish so that there is an element of repeated measures over time. However, while these repeated time‐point measurements help in establishing the temporal profile of phenomena such as migration or differentiation, they are not independent data points in the sense used for estimating monthly throughput.

Give details of addition of test compounds to test systems (e.g. in which compartment of compartmentalized cultures, in which volume, before after or during medium change, etc.).","The method is set up for 8 test conditions including 7 compound concentrations and one SC. The test conditions are prepared in a serial dilution from the stock solution (Figure 5). Stock solutions are prepared by diluting the compound in the solvent (e.g. DMSO) in a concentration that allows the preparation of the highest test concentration without exceeding the highest acceptable solvent concentration (see 0). For DMSO the highest acceptable solvent concentration is 0.1% which means that the stock concentration needs to be at least 1000x higher than the highest test concentration. Stock solutions in non-sterile solvents (e.g. water or PBS) have to be sterile filtrated using a sterile syringe filter (diameter 0.2 µm). Adsorption to the filter needs to be considered. Stock solutions are aliquoted and stored at -20°C. A stock solution is not thawed more than three times. For the preparation of the test condition the stock solution is diluted to the highest test concentration (default 1:1000) in differentiation medium. All following dilutions are prepared by serial dilutions of the highest concentration in differentiation medium containing solvent (in the concentration of the highest test concentration). The default serial dilution is 1:3 which covers a concentration range from e.g. 20 µM to 27 nM (729-fold). Depending on the desired concentration range, the dilution can be changed to 1:2, 1:5, 1:10 or other. The SC is prepared by adding the solvent to differentiation media in the same concentration as the highest test concentration. 100 µL of the compound dilutions and the SC are added to a 96-well plate (Figure 4). The serial dilution can also be prepared directly in the 96 well plates. hNPCs are added to each well after a 15 to 30 min equilibration period at 37°C and 5 % CO2. To subtract the background fluorescence of the phenol red-containing medium, 4 wells with medium only (Background, medium without cells, Figure 5) are prepared for the viability and cytotoxicity assays.Figure 5 Plating Scheme. The solvent control depends on the solvent of the compound that is tested. 7 compound concentrations are plated in a serial dilution from lowest (left) to highest (right) concentration. Lysis control (4 replicates for each timepoint, 72h and 120h) and background control (4 replicates) are used for the viability and cytotoxicity assays. Endpoint-specific controls for radial glia migration (PP2), neuronal differentiation (EGF) and oligodendrocyte differentiation (BMP7) are performed on each experimental plate (4 replicates each).",High,"The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the preparation and handling of compound stocks and dilutions, including details on volumes, solvents, sterility, storage, and the addition of test compounds to test systems. It addresses the range of volumes, specific lab ware, temperature considerations, media for dilution, solvent decision rules, and solubility tests. The explanation of stock preparation, dilution methods, and final addition to the test system is detailed and relevant, covering all aspects of the question.","The assay protocol uses precise volumes and calibrated liquid handling to ensure reproducibility. For example, compound dilutions are prepared in differentiation medium and then 100 µL of each dilution (including the solvent control) is dispensed into individual wells of 96‐well flat‐bottom plates. A liquid handling system or pipettes are employed to minimize pipetting variation, with outer wells often filled with water to mitigate edge effects. _(Source: NPC2-5.pdf)_

Compound stocks are prepared at a concentration at least 1000× above the highest test concentration so that, when diluted, the solvent (typically DMSO—in addition to alternatives such as DPBS, ddH₂O, or MeOH) does not exceed the maximum acceptable concentration (0.1% v/v for DMSO). When compounds are dissolved in non‐sterile solvents, the stock solutions are sterile‐filtrated through 0.2 µm syringe filters to ensure sterility. The stock solutions are aliquoted and stored at −20°C, and they are not allowed to undergo more than three freeze–thaw cycles. _(Source: NPC2-5.pdf)_

For the dilution process, the highest test concentration is first prepared by diluting the stock into differentiation medium. Subsequent dilutions are carried out as serial dilutions—commonly in a 1:3 dilution series—ensuring that each step maintains the same final solvent concentration as the highest test concentration. This careful approach also helps to confirm the solubility of each compound in the test medium, with solubility either established beforehand via databases/literature or confirmed experimentally. _(Source: NPC2-5.pdf)_

Regarding the final addition to the test system, after compound dilutions (100 µL per well) have been added to the pre-coated 96‐well plates (coated with poly‑D‑lysine/laminin), the plates are allowed to equilibrate for 15–30 minutes at 37°C and 5% CO₂. Only then are the human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) added. Medium exchanges (e.g. at day 3) involve replacing half of the medium with freshly prepared test condition solutions to maintain proper compound exposure. _(Source: NPC2-5.pdf)_

In summary, the process encompasses:  
• Using defined volumes (typically 100 µL per well) dispensed into 96-well plates with automated or manual pipetting systems.  
• Maintaining assay temperature (37°C, 5% CO₂) and controlled lighting conditions during incubation and imaging.  
• Diluting the compounds in differentiation medium (DMEM/Ham’s F12, 2:1 with additional supplements) in a serial dilution scheme while adhering to a rigid solvent concentration limit (e.g. 0.1% DMSO).  
• Preparing compound stocks at ≥1000× concentration, verifying solubility (via pilot or literature data), sterile filtering if required, aliquoting, and storing them at −20°C.  
• Adding the test compounds to the test system by pre-dispensing compound dilutions into the designated wells and then adding the cells after a brief equilibration period, as well as updating media during the culture period to maintain exposure.  

Each step is carefully designed to minimize variability and assure that compound exposures occur under tightly regulated conditions. _(Source: NPC2-5.pdf)_",0.836207880196616,0.1980549693107605,0.10064937174320221,0.15084749460220337

For each practical experiment, the lab‐specific procedure for calculating test compound concentrations starts with the preparation of a highly concentrated stock solution (at least 1,000 times higher than the highest test concentration to comply with the acceptable solvent limits). The stock is then diluted in the differentiation medium to prepare the highest test concentration, and subsequent serial dilutions (typically 1:3, although alternatives like 1:2, 1:5, or 1:10 can be used) are performed to cover the intended concentration range. All these dilution steps, calculations, and the final test concentrations are documented in the AXES sheet, ensuring that each experiment’s conditions are clearly traceable.

Plate maps are defined according to a pre-established plating scheme (see, for example, Figure 5 in the document).

The response is incomplete and lacks clarity on several aspects of the question.","The pipetting schedule is planned in advance in accordance with the approved assay protocol and is documented in the experiment’s metadata sheet (the AXES sheet). Operators adhere to predefined pipetting times (for example, during compound dilution, feeding, and plating) which are scheduled, monitored, and then logged.

"How is the concentration range of test compounds defined (e.g. only single concentrations, always 1:10 serial dilutions or variable dilution factors, ten different concentrations, etc.)? Is there a rule for defining starting dilutions? For functional endpoints that may not provide full concentration-response, how is the test concentration defined? E.g. EC10 of viability data are usually tested for gene expression endpoints. Detailed information should also be included in an SOP, preferably in DB-ALM format (see link in 6.6).","Starting concentrations and concentration ranges are defined based on the following factors: - toxicological relevance of the compound (i.e. internal human exposures, effects at lowest concentrations) - solubility of the compound - highest useable solvent concentration These factors are determined based on available information (databases/literature) or experimentally (e.g. solubility test).",Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by mentioning factors that influence the definition of starting concentrations and concentration ranges, such as toxicological relevance, solubility, and solvent concentration. However, it lacks specific details on the concentration range (e.g., single concentrations, serial dilutions) and does not address how test concentrations are defined for functional endpoints that may not provide full concentration-response. Additionally, there is no mention of an SOP or DB-ALM format.","The concentration range is defined by a number of factors rather than using a fixed scheme like “always 1:10 dilutions” or “ten different concentrations.” According to the document, the highest test concentration is chosen so that when diluted into differentiation medium the solvent (for example DMSO) does not exceed its acceptable concentration (0.1% for DMSO). Stock solutions must be prepared at least 1000‐fold more concentrated than that highest test concentration. Then, eight test conditions are set up on a plate (seven compound concentrations plus one solvent control) and the subsequent series is prepared by serial dilution. The default dilution factor is 1:3—covering, for example, a concentration range from 20 µM down to 27 nM (a 729‑fold range). However, the dilution factor can be adjusted (e.g. 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, or others) depending on the desired concentration range, the compound’s toxicological relevance, and its solubility.

For endpoints that do not yield a full concentration–response (such as when only a limited effect is detected), the test concentration is defined in a similar way to how one would derive an EC10 from a viability assay. In other words, the concentration used for these “functional endpoints” is chosen to correspond to a low but significant effect level (analogous to an EC10) as determined from other more sensitive endpoints. Detailed instructions on how to set up these dilutions and on the experimental design are provided in the SOP, which is available in DB‑ALM format (see section 6.6 in the document).

Coated plates should be stored at 4°C for no longer than 7 days.

Sources of variation: - Pipetting steps: Each pipetting step is a source of variation. Especially in the viability and cytotoxicity assays where the volume pipetted determines the final readout. - ICC: The staining consists of multiple washing steps. As pipetting errors add up in each washing step, there is variation in the dilution of blocking solution and antibodies. - NPC differentiation: The biological variation between the differentiation of different NPC spheres cannot be controlled and can lead to variations in the endpoints neuronal and oligodendrocyte differentiation. Known Pitfalls: - Spill over from the lysis control wells to other wells can happen and needs to be controlled by the operator. It is important to completely empty the 3-day lysis control wells after they have been used and fill them with water, to avoid spill over during the last 2 days of the experiment. - Multiple washing steps in the ICC staining lead to added pipetting errors and may cause differences in the volume in each well. Here the operator needs to control that the spheres are always covered by PBS. Differences between the wells can be corrected by the operator.",High,"The answer comprehensively addresses the question by identifying problematic compounds, critical handling steps, sources of variation, and known pitfalls. It provides specific examples and detailed explanations for each aspect, ensuring clarity and completeness in addressing the question.","Problematic compounds include:  
• Volatile compounds, highly lipophilic compounds (with high KOW), and compounds with low solubility in the established solvents because they may precipitate or require modification of the exposure protocol.  
• Fluorescent compounds may interfere with the readouts of viability and cytotoxicity assays, as their intrinsic fluorescence could obscure the detection of assay signals.  
   
Experimental variables that are hard to control include:  
• Variability introduced during multiple pipetting steps (e.g. during ICC staining washes and compound dilution steps) which can lead to errors in reagent volumes and inconsistent antibody dilutions.  
• The cell differentiation variability inherent to the maturation and sphere selection process, where slight differences in sphere size or handling can affect migration and differentiation endpoints.  
• Fluorescence interference from the medium components (like phenol red) and the test compounds themselves, which complicates background subtraction for viability and cytotoxicity measurements.  
   
Critical handling steps during assay execution include:  
• Ensuring that the poly-D-lysine/laminin coating is performed correctly and that coated plates are not used beyond 7 days at 4°C as improper coating can negatively affect cell migration and differentiation.  
• Minimizing the re-opening of incubators and avoiding vibrations to prevent sphere aggregation.  
• Careful pipetting during medium exchange and ICC staining—especially to avoid spillover from lysis control wells (which, if not properly emptied and refilled with water, may contaminate neighboring wells) and to maintain consistent coverage of spheres with PBS during washes.  
• Rapid dilution of DMSO in the thawing medium to protect cell health.  
   
Robustness issues and known pitfalls include:  
• Operator variability during manual pipetting and sphere selection, which may lead to noticeable inter-well or inter-experiment variability.  
• Variability introduced by differences in consumables (such as batch effects with FGF that contains serum albumin) or plate formats (edge effects, for example, require outer wells to be filled with water).  
• Possible mistakes such as spillover from lysis control wells, inconsistent washing during ICC staining (leading to variable antibody concentrations), and inadequate handling of spheres (e.g. not ensuring they are always covered by PBS during multiple washing steps).

b) Other analytical methods for the same endpoint: Besides the standard ICC staining followed by automated analysis with Omnisphero, the method can be modified to use alternative imaging approaches or analytical software.

c) Other exposure schemes: The current protocol uses a 120‑hour exposure with a feeding step at 72 h. Variations include shorter exposures (e.g., 24 h migration assessment for NPC2a or 72 h for neuronal differentiation as reported in literature) or repeated/prolonged exposures in which the compound is applied in a repeated dose or over an extended differentiation period.

These related tests include:

1. NPC2a – assessing radial glia migration (with two database entries, one for 72 h and one for 120 h; for example, “NPC2a_DNT_hNPC_mig_72h_20200317v1.1” and “NPC2a_DNT_hNPC_mig_120h_20200317v1.1”).  
2. NPC2b – assessing neuronal migration (database name: “NPC2b_DNT_hNPC_mig_120h_20200317v1.1”).  
3. NPC2c – assessing oligodendrocyte migration (database name: “NPC2c_DNT_hNPC_mig_120h_20200317v1.1”).  
4. NPC3 – assessing neuronal differentiation (database name: “NPC3_DNT_hNPC_diff_120h_20200317v1.1”).  
5. NPC4 – assessing neuronal morphology by measuring neurite length and area (database names: “NPC4_DNT_hNPC_diff_120h_20200317v1.1” with additional ToxCast entries for neurite length and neurite area).  
6. NPC5 – assessing oligodendrocyte differentiation (database name: “NPC5_DNT_hNPC_diff_120h_20200317v1.1”).

Short description and differences:  
• Each test focuses on a distinct neurodevelopmental process (i.e. different modes of cell migration or differentiation) while the overall NPC2‐5 method uses a common experimental setup (e.g. plating neurospheres on coated plates and immunocytochemical image analysis) to generate multiple DNT‐specific endpoints from one experiment.  
• The individual tests differ in their readouts: for example, NPC2a is dedicated to measuring the radial migration distance (either at 72 or 120 h), whereas NPC3 quantifies the percentage of neurons (β‑III-tubulin–positive cells) and NPC5 quantifies oligodendrocyte differentiation based on O4 expression.  
• Additionally, variations in exposure schemes have been applied (e.g. a 24‑h NPC2a migration protocol or a 72‑h protocol for neuronal differentiation in NPC3), providing alternative formats compared to the standard 120‑h protocol described in the present method.

High throughput transcriptomics/deep sequencing:  
Beyond the image‐based endpoints, the test system has been characterized by high throughput transcriptomic analyses. Proliferating, 3‑day differentiated, and 5‑day differentiated hNPCs have been profiled to capture changes in key neurodevelopmental processes such as migration, differentiation, and signaling pathway modulation (e.g. BMP, Notch, and EGF signaling). This omics characterization provides an alternative endpoint that complements the phenotypic (imaging) readouts of the current assay.

"What is the data format? Raw data: give general explanation. Upload an exemplary file of raw data (e.g. Excel file as exported out of plate reader). Provide an example of processed data at a level suitable for general display and comparison of conditions and across experiments and methods. If the file format is not proprietary or binary, include a template. This will help other users to provide their data in a similar way to the general data infrastructure. Example as used in EU-ToxRisk: Excel sheet with columns specifying line number, assay name, date of experiment, identifier for reference to partner lab book, compound, concentration (in: -log[M]), line number of corresponding control, number of replicates, endpoints, data of endpoint(s), etc.","Raw data processing, curve fitting and hit definition (prediction) are performed using CRStats (Concentration- Response Statistics), an R package for concentration-response analysis automation for in vitro test systems optimized for multi-well plate experiments based on drc (https://github.com/iuf-duesseldorf/fritsche-lab- CRStats; Keßel et al. (pre-print at BioRxiv; doi: 10.1101/2022.10.18.512648)). The raw data format is different depending on the endpoints. For all endpoints assessed in a multiplate reader (viability and cytotoxicity), the raw data format are excel files containing values (one for each endpoint, timepoint and well) measured as relative fluorescence units. These values are transferred from the original excel file into the AXES sheet. The original excel output files are saved for traceability of the data.

Original brightfield images are archived for 10 years. All other raw data is computed from the ICC images in the Omnisphero software and is exported and saved as one csv file. From there the values are again transferred to the AXES sheets. The following data is exported from Omnisphero: - number of all cells in the migration area (cell number) - number of all neurons in the migration area - number of all oligodendrocytes in the migration area - radial glia migration (µm) - mean neuronal migration (µm) - mean oligodendrocyte migration (µm) - neurite length (µm or pixels) - neurite area (pixel) All original ICC images are archived for 10 years.",Medium,"The answer provides some details about the raw data format and processing, mentioning the use of Excel and CSV files, and the types of data exported. However, it lacks a clear example of processed data suitable for general display and comparison, and does not include a template or exemplary file as requested. The explanation is somewhat fragmented and could be more comprehensive and organized to fully address the question.","Based on the NPC2‐5 description, the raw data files are initially generated as non‐proprietary Excel or CSV files. For endpoints measured in a multiplate reader (e.g. viability and cytotoxicity), the raw output is exported from the instrument in Excel format with one value per well (typically in relative fluorescence units, RFUs). Likewise, measurements performed manually (e.g. radial glia migration distance via ImageJ) or extracted from automated image analysis (for ICC endpoints) are directly copied or exported as numerical values (e.g. in µm for migration distances) and then transferred into a central “AXES sheet.” This AXES sheet collects all the raw numerical readouts from each well/plate for traceability.

A processed data file is then generated by normalizing the raw values to the appropriate control (for instance, by normalizing each replicate to the median of the solvent control) and averaging over technical replicates. The processed data typically include summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation) and endpoint‐specific calculations (for example, percent neuronal differentiation, mean neurite length, etc.). The data are then used for curve fitting (using an R package such as “drc” or a dedicated tool like CRStats) to generate concentration–response curves from which benchmark concentrations (BMCs) and confidence limits are calculated.

However, it lacks clarity and completeness in explaining the overall workflow, such as how normalization is consistently applied across different assays, and does not explicitly mention how summary data like EC50 or BMC15 are derived from these steps.","The assay raw data are first collected either as numerical readouts (e.g. relative fluorescence units from viability/cytotoxicity measurements) or as image‐derived values (e.g. migration distances, cell numbers, neurite metrics from ICC images) and are then transferred into an AXES sheet. The following steps are applied:

1. Background Correction – For endpoints measured via a multiplate reader (e.g. viability or cytotoxicity assays), values from wells containing medium only (“background wells”) are used so that the background fluorescence is subtracted from each response value. For example, the raw viability value (RFU) gets adjusted by subtracting the medium-only (background) RFU.

2. Data Transfer – Raw numbers are imported into the AXES sheets. In the case of endpoints based on image analysis (migration, differentiation, neurite length/area), the data are exported as CSV files from the automated Omnisphero software and then manually or automatically pasted into the AXES sheet alongside manually measured values (e.g. migration in µm measured in ImageJ for radial glia migration at 72 h).

3. Normalization to Solvent Control – Each replicate’s response is normalized to the median value of the solvent control (SC) in that experiment. For instance, endpoints such as neuronal differentiation are calculated as the percentage of neurons (number of β‑III-tubulin‐positive cells divided by total Hoechst-positive cells ×100). Similarly, migration endpoints like neuronal migration are expressed as a ratio relative to the radial glia migration (i.e. mean neuronal migration divided by radial glia migration ×100).

4. Re‐normalization to the Starting Point – The curve’s starting point is determined, and all normalized response values are then re‐normalized by dividing by the starting point value and multiplying by 100. This ensures that the concentration–response curve begins at 100% for the lowest (assumed non‐effect) concentration.

5. Curve Fitting and Statistical Analysis – The normalized data are then processed using an R‑based tool (using the “drc” package as implemented in the Fritsche‐lab CRStats tool) for non‐linear curve fitting. Several models are tested, and the optimal curve is chosen based on Akaike’s information criterion. From these fitted curves, summary parameters such as EC₅₀ (or other effective concentration estimates), benchmark concentrations (BMCs) with defined Benchmark Responses (BMR, e.g. 10% or 30% change), as well as upper and lower confidence limits (BMCU and BMCL) are derived. The BMCs can also serve as points of departure (PoD). For cytotoxicity endpoints, a slight variation is used: the response is normalized as “normalized response = (lysis control – response)/(lysis control – solvent control)” to account for maximal cell lysis.

6. Calculation of Ratios – Finally, additional ratios (e.g. neuronal migration relative to radial glia migration, oligodendrocyte migration relative to the migration distance of the entire nucleus population) are calculated using the formulas provided in the assay description.

This systematic pre‑processing—from background correction, data transfer, normalization to solvent control, re‑normalization to the starting point, non‑linear curve fitting with the “drc” R package, and final calculation of ratios/summary parameters—ensures that summary data such as EC₅₀, BMC values, ratios, and PoD are derived consistently from the raw assay measurements.

"How are data normally handled to obtain the overall test result (e.g. concentration response fitting using model X, determination of EC50 by method Y, use of EC50 as final data)? How do you model your concentration response curve (e.g. LL.4 parameter fit) and which software do you use (e.g. GraphPad Prism, R, etc.)? Do you usually calculate an uncertainty measure of your summary data (e.g. a 95% confidence interval for the BMC or a BMCL), and with which software? Can you give uncertainty for non-cytotoxicity or no-effect? How do you handle non-monotonic curve shapes or other curve features that are hard to describe with the usual mathematical fit model?","The data is normalized to the SC and re-normalized to the starting point of the curve. For the normalization to the SC each replicate data point is normalized to the median of the SC in the respective experiment. For the cytotoxicity assays the following normalization is used instead of the normalization to the SC. Here again each response value is normalized using the median of the lysis control and the median of the solvent control. lysis control − response normalized response = lysis control − solvent control The R package drc is used to calculate the optimal curve-fit for each experiment (https://github.com/iuf- duesseldorf/fritsche-lab-CRStats; Keßel et al. (pre-print at BioRxiv; doi: 10.1101/2022.10.18.512648). For calculations of curve fits and BMCs, the data from independent experiments is pooled (median of all replicate values for one concentration). Several non-linear models are run with the concentration response data of each endpoint and the Akaike´s information criterion is used to determine the best fit. For re-normalization of the data, the response value of the curves starting point is determined and used to re-normalize all response values. Therefore, each mean response value is divided by the starting point of the curve and multiplied by 100. For the re-normalized response values the curve fitting is repeated to produce the final concentration response curve. For deriving a reference point (RP) or point of departure (Pod) the Benchmark Concentration (BMC) approach, as recommended by the EFSA Scientific Committee (Hardy et al., 2017), is applied. The BMC approach makes use of all data points that define the fitted concentration response curve. Thereby, the BMC is defined as the concentration that is associated with a specific change in response, the Benchmark Response (BMR). The BMR is a value of effect size and should be defined as an effect size that is higher than the general variability of the measured endpoint. The BMR is therefore determined based on the variability of the respective endpoint. BMR for NPC2-5: Primary DNT specific endpoints of the test method are: radial glia migration 72 h (NPC2a) radial glia migration 120h (NPC2a) neuronal migration 120 h (NPC2b) oligodendrocyte migration 120h (NPC2c) BMR30 neuronal differentiation 120 h (NPC3) neurite length 120 h (NPC4) neurite area 120 h (NPC4) BMR10 BMR10 BMR30 BMR30 BMR30 BMR30 oligodendrocyte differentiation 120h (NPC5) BMR30 Secondary endpoints are: cell number 120 h BMR30 cytotoxicity 72 h BMR10 cytotoxicity 120 h BMR10 viability 120 h BMR30 Based on the BMR and the concentration response curve, the evaluation tool calculates the BMC, as well as upper and lower confidence limits (BMCU and BMCL respectively) based on the predict function in the R package drc. The predict function calculates the prediction bands around the concentration response curve based on the deviation between independent experiments and gives an estimation of the area that is expected to enclose 95% of future data points. The BMCL is thereby defined as the intersection of the lower band and the BMR while the BMCU is defined as the intersection of the upper band and the BMR. The confidence intervals are used to access the uncertainty of the BMC. If the BMCU is 1.5 times above the test range, the original BMCU is replaced by 1.5x the highest tested concentration.",High,"The answer comprehensively addresses the question by detailing the data handling process, including normalization and re-normalization methods, the use of the R package 'drc' for curve fitting, and the application of the BMC approach for deriving reference points. It also explains the calculation of uncertainty measures using confidence intervals and addresses the handling of non-monotonic curve shapes. The response is relevant, complete, and provides specific software and methodological details, fulfilling the requirements of the question.","The data from the assay are processed in several steps before arriving at a summary result. First, raw data (from the viability, cytotoxicity, migration, differentiation, etc.) are normalized to the solvent control, and for many endpoints, then re‐normalized by dividing by the response value at the starting point of the curve (ENV/CBC/MONO(2023)13, pp. 146–147). Next, the concentration–response curves are modeled by fitting several non‐linear models (e.g. a four‑parameter logistic model—which is essentially an LL.4 parameter fit) using an R‐based tool (CRStats) that incorporates the R package drc. In this process, the best fit is selected based on criteria such as the Akaike information criterion (ENV/CBC/MONO(2023)13, p. 147).

For uncertainty estimation, a benchmark concentration (BMC) approach is applied. The R package’s predict function is used to generate 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the BMC, which provides uncertainty measures (BMCL and BMCU). In cases where no effect is seen (non‐cytotoxicity or no-effect conditions) or when the upper limit spans above the tested concentration range, expert judgment is applied. For endpoints that are difficult to fit—such as those with non‐monotonic curve shapes or other complex behaviors—the usual mathematical fit (e.g. the logistic model) might not capture the full curve shape. In these instances, additional testing, adjusting the concentration range, or relying on expert review of the data is used to decide if the observed effect is a true hit or an artifact (ENV/CBC/MONO(2023)13, pp. 146–151).

Thus, overall:
• Data are normalized (to SC and the starting point), then curve‐fitted using several non‐linear models (typically a LL.4 parameter logistic model) by means of an R-based setup (CRStats/drc).
• Uncertainty is quantified via 95% CI for the BMC (with BMCL and BMCU calculated using R’s predict function).
• In cases of non‐cytotoxicity, no effect, or non-monotonic curves, uncertainty is dealt with by additional statistical significance testing (e.g. Tukey HSD) and expert judgment to ensure the correct classification of the compound’s effect.

"What is the scientific rationale to link test method data to a relevant in vivo adverse outcome? Which toxicological target (organ, tissue, physiological/biochemical function, etc.) is modelled? Which biological process(es) (e.g. neurite outgrowth, differentiation) are modelled/reflected by your test method? Which toxicological events (e.g. oxidative stress, cell death) are modelled/reflected by your test method? To which (human) adverse outcome(s) is your test method related? Which hazard(s) do(es) your test method (potentially) predict?","Primary hNPCs are isolated from the fetal brain and can be used to model neurodevelopmental processes like migration of radial glia, neurons and oligodendrocytes, neurite outgrowth and differentiation into neurons and oligodendrocytes within this test method. The test system therefore measures adverse events in the young (fetal) developing brain. Thereby, the biological processes that are modeled are: 1. radial glia cell migration (NPC2a) 2. migration of young cortical neurons (NPC2b) 3. oligodendrocyte migration (NPC2c) 4. fetal neuronal differentiation into young neurons (NPC3) 5. neurite outgrowth of young fetal neurons (NPC4) 6. oligodendrocyte formation of fetal NPC (NPC5) The toxicological events that are modeled include events that impact the above-mentioned biological processes in any direction (increase or decrease). Thereby, neurodevelopmental processes represented by the NPC2-NPC5 assay are guided by a variety of pathways known to contribute to the respective processes in vivo as assessed by hNPC exposure to in vivo relevant signaling pathway modulators (summarized in Table13, Masjosthusmann et al. 2020; Koch et al., 2022). All the endpoints can be assessed in a high content format within one experiment due to the multi-cellularity and high developmental dynamic of the neurospheres. In addition, the strength of the system is that it allows KE-based assessment of human neurodevelopment without the need to perform species extrapolation. Moreover, the self-organized mixed culture system contains cell-cell interactions e.g. via gap junction channels as cells die when cell-cell communication is blocked by gap junction blockers (unpublished observations). Hence, the system is superior to single-cell 2D systems, since due to its nature it mimics a multitude of neurodevelopmental processes. One limitation of the hNPC model is the restricted timing. These endpoints represent early processes of neurodevelopment during the fetal period. Neurons stay immature hence later processes like synaptogenesis cannot be studied. Moreover, correct positioning, like one can study in vivo with cortical layering, cannot be studied here, since the assay mimics cortical radial glia and neuronal migration but does not cortical layer formation. The test method predicts the hazard of a chemical to induce developmental neurotoxicity by causing neurophysiological, functional and behavioral changes in the developing nervous system.",High,"The answer comprehensively addresses the scientific rationale by detailing the biological processes and toxicological events modeled by the test method, such as neurodevelopmental processes and cell migration. It specifies the toxicological targets and adverse outcomes related to human neurodevelopment, and it explains the hazards the test method predicts, such as developmental neurotoxicity. The answer also discusses the strengths and limitations of the model, providing a complete and relevant response to the question.","The scientific rationale is based on the idea that measuring key neurodevelopmental processes in human fetal neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) in vitro can provide a mechanistic link to in vivo adverse outcomes related to neurodevelopment. In this assay, cells derived from the human fetal cortex are used to model several interrelated processes which, if disrupted, are known to impair brain development and ultimately lead to cognitive dysfunction.

Specifically:

• Toxicological target: The assay focuses on the developing brain – using primary human neural progenitor cells from the fetal cortex (GW16–19) as the target system.

• Biological processes modelled: The assay reflects critical developmental processes such as:
 – Radial glia migration (NPC2a)
 – Neuronal and oligodendrocyte migration (NPC2b and NPC2c)
 – Neuronal differentiation (NPC3)
 – Neurite outgrowth (neurite length and area; NPC4)
 – Oligodendrocyte differentiation (NPC5)  
These processes are crucial for proper cortical organization and connectivity. (Source: NPC2-5.pdf)

• Toxicological events modelled: The assay evaluates disturbances in cell migration and differentiation (including changes in neurite length/area), as well as general endpoints such as cell viability and cytotoxicity. Disruption in these endpoints can indicate adverse events such as impairments in cell health, altered differentiation programs, and defective cell–cell contacts, all of which could contribute to developmental neurotoxicity. (Source: NPC2-5.pdf)

• Related (human) adverse outcome: When disrupted, the modeled processes can lead to altered brain development and, in vivo, may result in cognitive dysfunction. (Source: NPC2-5.pdf)

• Predicted hazard: The test method is designed to predict hazards that have the potential to interfere with neurodevelopment by affecting migration, differentiation, or neurite outgrowth. Thus, it is aimed at identifying chemical compounds that may cause developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) by disrupting these cellular events.

What is a ‘hit’ if the test is used in screening mode (= hit definition, if different from above)?","Two prediction models (PM) are applied for the NPC2-5 assay. One PM for a downregulation (PM downregulation) and one PM for an upregulation (PM upregulation) in cell differentiation and migration. PM down regulation The PM uses hit definition based on comparison of the confidence intervals (CI) for the BMC of the DNT- specific endpoint (BMCs) and the unspecific endpoint (cytotoxicity/viability; BMCus). Thereby the following four hit classifications apply: “no hit” The compound is not defined as hit. “specific hit”: The compound is defined as hit and the CI’s do not overlap, meaning that the upper confidence limit of the specific endpoint (BMCUs) is lower than the lower confidence limit of the unspecific endpoint (BMCLus). The compound is defined as hit and the CI of the specific endpoint overlaps by less than or equal to 10% with the CI of the unspecific endpoint. The compound is defined as hit and the CI of the specific endpoint overlaps by more than 10% with the CI of the unspecific endpoints. “borderline hit”: “unspecific hit” The compound is classified as a hit, if the concentration response curve generates a BMC and if the CI is within the test range. In case the CI spans above the test range, the compound is only classified as hit, if the highest test concentration is significantly different from the lowest test concentration. The adjusted significance (p<0.05) is thereby determined using a Tukey HSD test. The decision process for the prediction model is described in the flow chart in Figure 11. Figure 11: Decision tree for the PM for downregulation applied for test method NPC2-5. Overview of the decisions leading to the classification of a compound in one of four categories: “no hit”, “specific hit”, “borderline hit” and “unspecific hit”. Specific consideration for the prediction model: In case no confidence limits are available for the unspecific endpoint because the BMR is not reached, the BMCLus is assumed to be the highest tested concentration. If the CI of the specific endpoint spans above the test range for a compound identified as “hit” based on statistical significance, expert judgement is applied to define, if the “hit” is specific or unspecific. Therefore, all datapoints of the unspecific and specific endpoint of the highest test concentration are compared. If these data points do not overlap, the compound is classified as “specific hit”, otherwise as “unspecific hit”. In general, BMCs based on the same BMR are compared (e.g. BMC30us vs BMC30s). In case the BMC30us is not available for an endpoint that allows the generation of a BMC10us, the BMC10us is used instead. If the classification of this comparison is “unspecific hit”, the compound will be flagged as “check manually“ as the BMC10us is lower than the BMC30us leading to a higher probability of a false classification. To avoid such false classification expert judgement is needed. Compounds can also be flagged as “check manually”, if the classification based on the viability is different from the classification based on the cytotoxicity and if the confidence interval is very wide (BMCU/BMCL > 25), which means a high uncertainty for the BMC estimation. In both cases expert judgement is needed to decide on the classification. The expert judgement is an individual decision process, that accounts for effect size, curve progression, statistical significance and overall standard deviation. If the concentration response curves do not give enough information for decision by expert judgement, additional testing or testing in a different concentration range should be performed. For compounds that reduce the cell number or radial glia migration the viability is not used as unspecific endpoint. The reason is that an effect in both endpoints indirectly affects cell viability. In this case only the cytotoxicity is used for the classification. PM upregulation In contrast to the PM for downregulation, the PM for upregulation is based on a hit definition without the comparison of confidence intervals (CI) between the specific and unspecific endpoint. The reason is that specific and unspecific endpoint do not have the same relationship during an induction compared to a reduction in the endpoint. A loss in general cell health will likely result in an effect in e.g cell migration or differentiation, while an induction in cell health (measured as mitochondrial activity) does not necessarily increase these endpoints. The following three hit classifications apply: “no hit” The compound is not defined as hit. “specific hit”: The compound is defined as hit and the effect is not an artifact due to loss in cell health. “unspecific hit” The compound is defined as hit in only the unspecific endpoints. The compound is classified as hit, if the concentration response curve generates a BMC and if the CI is within the test range. In case the CI spans above the test range, the compound is only classified as hit, if the highest test concentration is significantly different form the lowest test concentration. The adjusted significance (p<0.05) is thereby determined using a Tukey HSD test. The decision process for the prediction model is described in the flow chart in figure 7. Figure 7: Decision tree for the PM for upregulation applied for test method NPC2-5. Overview of the decisions leading to the classification of a compound in one of three categories: “no hit”, “specific hit”, and “unspecific hit”. In case a compound is classified as hit together with a reduction in an unspecific endpoint, it needs to be clarified if the induction is a specific effect or an artifact due to a loss in cell viability or an increase in cytotoxicity. Therefore, expert judgement is applied which accounts for effect size, curve progression, statistical significance, overall standard deviation but also morphological changes of the spheres. Expert judgement is additionally applied if the confidence interval is very wide (BMCU/BMCL > 25) which means a high uncertainty for the BMC estimation.",Medium,"The answer provides a detailed description of the prediction models for both downregulation and upregulation, including hit classifications and decision processes. However, it lacks specific statistical details such as threshold values, variance, and the rationale for these thresholds. The explanation is complex and may not be fully clear without accompanying figures or additional context, which affects completeness and clarity.","Below is a summary of the benchmark response (BMR) thresholds, statistical rationale, and limitations of the prediction model as applied in the NPC2-5 assay:

1. For dichotomized endpoints (i.e. a binary toxic versus non‐toxic outcome), the prediction model is set up using a comparison of the concentration–response curve–derived benchmark concentration (BMC) and its 95% confidence interval for a specific DNT endpoint versus that of an unspecific endpoint (usually cytotoxicity or viability). In the “PM downregulation” model the compound is considered a “specific hit” (toxic) when the upper confidence limit of the specific endpoint (e.g. neuronal differentiation, which is set with a BMR of 30% change for NPC3) is lower than the lower confidence limit of the unspecific endpoint (e.g. cytotoxicity using a BMR of 10%; see pages 148–150). A “borderline hit” is defined when there is an overlap of ≤10% between the two confidence intervals. In contrast, if the two confidence intervals overlap by more than 10%, the compound is classified as an “unspecific hit” (suggesting that the effects are likely due to general cell health rather than a DNT‐specific effect).  
_(Source: NPC2-5.pdf, pages 148–151)_

2. For pseudo-dichotomized outcomes (i.e. those with three categories: toxic, borderline, and non-toxic), the borderline range is defined based on a limited overlap (≤10%) between the confidence intervals for the specific DNT endpoint and the unspecific endpoint. Thus, compounds falling into this borderline zone do not unambiguously separate from the solvent control but also do not display a complete shift comparable to the “specific hit”.  
_(Source: NPC2-5.pdf, pages 148–151)_

3. For multi‐class or continuous outcomes (endpoints such as migration distance, neuronal differentiation, neurite length, etc.), the definitions use continuous quantitative measures. For example, the BMR thresholds for primary DNT endpoints are set as follows:  
  • Radial glia migration (72 h and 120 h): BMR = 10% change  
  • Neuronal migration, oligodendrocyte migration, neuronal differentiation, neurite length/area, oligodendrocyte differentiation: BMR = 30% change  
The rationale for these thresholds is twofold. Mathematically, the BMR is chosen to be larger than the inherent variability of the measured endpoint (for example, differences that exceed the baseline variability or a multiple of the standard deviation) and is also set on a biological basis to represent a change that is likely toxicologically relevant (for instance, a ≥30% reduction/increase in a key neurodevelopmental process). In some cases, additional endpoints, such as cell viability, are not interpreted in isolation because a reduction in viability may simply reflect a lower cell count rather than a selective adverse functional change.  
_(Source: NPC2-5.pdf, pages 147 and 148)_

Rationale and Toxicological Basis for the Thresholds:
• The thresholds are set so that the effect size (BMR) is larger than the inter‐ and intra-experimental variability. For example, for radial glia migration the acceptance range is defined (e.g. 700–1500 µm at 72 h), and the BMR (10% change) reflects a deviation that is statistically robust relative to biological variation.  
• There is also a biological rationale since the NPC2-5 assay is designed to capture key neurodevelopmental processes (e.g. migration and differentiation) so that a shift beyond the BMR level is considered likely to contribute to cognitive dysfunction in the developing brain.  
_(Source: NPC2-5.pdf, pages 147–149)_

Limitations of the Prediction Model:
• The prediction model, while statistically robust, can be limited by variability introduced by technical factors (e.g. pipetting errors, ICC staining variability) and biological heterogeneity inherent in primary hNPC cultures.  
• In cases where the confidence intervals are very wide or span above the test range, expert judgment is required for classifying a hit.  
• Not all neurotoxicity modes of action are covered by the endpoints measured in this assay; hence, the assay is best used as part of an integrated testing battery.  
• The model may miss compounds whose effects are mediated by pathways not directly assessed by these endpoints.  
_(Source: NPC2-5.pdf, pages 148–151 and 156)_

Hit Definition in Screening Mode:
When used in screening mode, a “hit” is defined as a compound for which the concentration–response curve yields a BMC within the test range along with a statistically significant separation from the control (e.g. as determined by a Tukey HSD test). In screening, a hit is flagged when the measured “specific” endpoint (post-normalization to the control) exceeds the preset BMR threshold (either 10% or 30%, depending on the endpoint) while maintaining a low overlap with unspecific endpoints.  
_(Source: NPC2-5.pdf, pages 148–151)_

In summary, the threshold settings are based on both statistical criteria (confidence intervals and variability measurements) and toxicological relevance (selected % changes that reflect biological adversity). The prediction model classifies compounds as “no hit,” “borderline hit,” “unspecific hit,” or “specific hit,” with the latter indicating toxicity if the specific neurodevelopmental endpoints are affected beyond the benchmark response while general cell health is not proportionately compromised.

If the PM is two-sided, do different rules, characteristics and interpretations apply to the two sides (e.g. is a decrease in viability or an increase in viability both interpreted as an effect/toxicity; are thresholds and performance characteristics to both sides the same?).","The prediction model is set up as a statistical model which uses the 95 % confidence intervals (assessed based on the prediction bands around the concentration response curve) to determine the uncertainty of a hit definition. In the case of high uncertainty in the confidence interval, (e.g. because the CI spans above the tested concentration range) the model additionally considers the statistical significance between the highest and the lowest test concentration. Next to the hit definition the uncertainty given by the 95 % CI is also considered in the specificity analyses (see 8.2 for a more detailed description). The model has been tested on a set of 17 DNT negative- and 9 human DNT positive compounds (see 5.6 and 5.7). All negative compounds were correctly classified as “no hit” while 6 positive compounds were correctly classified as “specific hit”. Here it is important to mention, that it is not expected that the NPC2-5 assay identifies all DNT positive compounds as not all of those compounds act via the mode-of-action (MoA) represented by the NPC2-5 assay. For most compounds the exact MoA for their neurodevelopmental adversity is not precisely known, yet other mechanisms like synaptogenesis and neuronal network formation are amongst the known DNT MoAs.",Medium,"The answer provides some details about the prediction model setup, including the use of 95% confidence intervals and statistical significance for hit definition, and mentions the test set of chemicals (17 DNT negative and 9 human DNT positive compounds). However, it lacks clarity on the specific classifiers or statistical approaches used, does not address whether the process is documented in a publication, and does not fully explain how the model applies to changes on both sides of controls or how data in the opposite direction are handled. The answer is partially complete but lacks comprehensive details on several aspects of the question.","The prediction model was not built using a “machine‐learning classifier” in the usual sense but was implemented as a statistical framework that fits concentration–response curves and then uses the resulting benchmark concentration (BMC) and its 95% confidence interval to decide on a “hit.” In essence, two separate prediction models are applied:

1. PM for downregulation:  
 • It compares the BMCs (and respective confidence intervals) of specific DNT endpoints against those for unspecific endpoints (cytotoxicity and/or viability).  
 • The method uses several non‐linear models (with model selection guided by the Akaike information criterion) implemented via the R package drc. In addition, significance between the highest and lowest test concentrations is determined using a Tukey HSD test.  
 • The outcome categories (“no hit,” “specific hit,” “borderline hit,” and “unspecific hit”) are determined based on whether and how the confidence intervals for specific endpoints and unspecific endpoints overlap.

2. PM for upregulation:  
 • For endpoints that increase relative to the control, the hit definition is set up without a direct confidence interval comparison between specific and unspecific endpoints because the relationship is not symmetric (a gain in “cell health” measured by an increase in a viability readout does not have the same toxicological implication as a decrease).  
 • Instead, three categories (“no hit,” “specific hit,” and “unspecific hit”) are applied based on the fitted curve and statistical significance.

As to the training and testing of the model, according to the document the model was “tested on a set of 17 human DNT‐negative compounds and 9 human DNT‐positive compounds” (i.e. n = 26 compounds). These studies and corresponding performance parameters (with a reported specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 66.7%) are documented in the publications by Masjosthusmann et al. (2020) and Blum et al. (2023).

Regarding applicability to both “sides” of the control:
 • In these assays, two separate prediction models have been established: one for downregulation (decreases relative to the solvent control), and one for upregulation (increases relative to control).  
 • Thus, the system is not one‐sided. Because the biological relationships are different (for example, a decrease in viability or in endpoint values may indicate toxicologically relevant impairment, whereas an increase does not necessarily equate to “improved” or “adverse” cell health), different decision rules and threshold criteria apply on the two sides.  
 • In the downregulation case, the rules involve a comparison of the confidence intervals (such that a “specific hit” is declared only if the confidence interval for the specific endpoint does not overlap—or overlaps very minimally—with that of the unspecific endpoint). For upregulation, a direct CI comparison is not performed; instead, the hit is defined on signs of statistically significant induction that is not accompanied by a loss in cell health as determined by the unspecific endpoints.

The information is partially relevant but not comprehensive.","Below is a summary of the preliminary performance parameters based on the NPC2-5 assay documentation (Sources: NPC2-5.pdf):

1. Baseline variation (noise):  
 • Intra‑experimental variation (solvent control) is quantified as the coefficient of variation (CV) for various endpoints (e.g., radial glia migration 72h: 5.1 ± 1.9%; migration 120h: ~5.6 ± 2.3%; neuronal differentiation: 23.0 ± 8.9%).  
 • Inter‑experimental variation (raw data) ranges from about 9.6% to over 23% depending on the endpoint.  
  These estimates represent the variability “within” an experiment and “between” independent experiments (Table 3 in the document).

2. Signal-to-noise ratio and z‑factor:  
 • A “signal” is indicated by the response of standard positive controls (e.g., PP2 for radial glia migration, EGF for neuronal differentiation, BMP7 for oligodendrocyte differentiation). Although specific signal/noise ratios (and z‑factors) are not directly reported, the variability estimates and reproducibility of positive control results (see Table 3) suggest a clear separation between positive and solvent controls.  
 • The z‑factor is not explicitly determined in the provided documentation.

3. Specificity:  
 • The documented specificity of the assay is 100%.  
 • It was determined by testing the assay with a set of 17 compounds known not to affect neurodevelopmental endpoints in vivo; all these negatives were correctly classified as “no hit” (Source: NPC2-5.pdf, pages ~152–156).

4. Sensitivity:  
 • The sensitivity of the test method is reported as 66.7%.  
 • This value was determined by assessing a set of 9 compounds known to be positive for human developmental neurotoxicity (Source: NPC2-5.pdf, pages ~152–156).

5. Uncertainty measures:  
 • Uncertainty is addressed by calculating 95% confidence intervals around the concentration–response curves. Specifically, the lower and upper confidence limits (BMCL and BMCU) are derived using prediction bands from the R-based evaluation tool; ratios such as BMCU/BMCL serve as a measure of uncertainty (e.g., if the ratio exceeds 25, expert judgement is needed).  
 • Additionally, the intra- and inter‑experimental coefficient of variation (CV) provides further insight into measurement uncertainty (see Table 3).

6. Detection limit / Required change for measurability:  
 • The detection limit is defined via the chosen Benchmark Response (BMR). For example, endpoints like radial glia migration have a BMR10 (i.e. a 10% change), while other endpoints (e.g., neuronal migration, differentiation, neurite length/area) use BMR30 (30% change) to define the measurable effect.  
 • No explicit values for limit of detection (LOD) or limit of quantification (LOQ) are provided.

7. Inter‑operator variation and historical controls:  
 • Although the assay has been used by multiple operators over an 18‑month period, inter‑operator variability was not specifically determined.  
 • There is extensive data from historical controls available: over 400 independent experiments were used to estimate raw value variability, and more than 40 experiments were used for positive control evaluations.

In addition, for IVIVE the document does not discuss specific parameters such as glycoprotein (MDR1) expression or provide detailed information about the xenobiotic metabolism capacity apart from noting that hNPCs do not express CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 and have limited metabolic capacity (though they can upregulate glutathione-dependent protective mechanisms). Furthermore, the potential for compound accumulation due to frequent medium changes and compound re-addition is not quantitatively addressed, though such medium handling details are described.

In summary, while the document describes the general setup (e.g. plating conditions, medium composition, and feeding strategy) and some aspects of the test system’s metabolic capacity, it does not provide numerical details on lipid/protein contents of the medium or cells, cell volume, or precise culture dish surface area. Similarly, no IVIVE data or literature is provided, and the assay has not been previously used for IVIVE; no special IVIVE‐related considerations (beyond the general culture handling and limited xenobiotic metabolism) are detailed.

"Which compounds is the test likely to pick up correctly, where is it likely to fail? How does the test method react to mixtures and UVCBs? Are there areas (according to industry sector, compound chemistry, physical-chemical properties) that need to be excluded from testing, or that are particularly suitable? Which compound class cannot be detected (e.g. neurotransmitters for which the receptors are not expressed, endocrine disruptors in absence of respective pathway)? Are any compounds known to interfere with the test system (e.g. fluorescent or colored chemicals)?","Toxicological applicability domain The following compound classes have been tested successfully: - Industrial chemicals - Pesticide/biocides - cosmetics ingredients - pharmaceuticals Compounds need to be soluble in a solvent at a solubility where the solvent does not produce effects by itself in the test system (0 for established solvents). Compounds that are volatile or have a high lipophilicity have not been tested and might need more sophisticated exposure methods such as ‘passive dosing’. Biological applicability domain The neural progenitor cell migration and differentiation assay (NPC2-5) is based on primary hNPCs obtained from the human fetal cortex. As mentioned in 0 “Scientific principle”, the method depicts migration of radial glia, neurons and oligodendrocytes, neurite outgrowth and differentiation into neurons and oligodendrocytes from fetal hNPCs. Next to the endpoints represented by this test method there are several other necessary neurodevelopmental endpoints which need to be studied using other test methods. Neurodevelopmental processes not represented by this test method: • NPC proliferation (NPC1) • Neural Crest Cell (NCC) Migration • NPC apoptosis • Neuronal morphology • Synaptogenesis • Neuronal network formation • Neural Rosette Formation • hiPSC-derived NPC proliferation • hiPSC-NPC neuronal differentiation • Neuronal subtype differentiation • Astrocyte Differentiation and Maturation • Astrocyte Reactivity • Microglia reactivity • Myelination For a complete assessment of developmental neurotoxicity, the test method needs to be part of a test battery. The information on signaling pathways modulating the neurodevelopmental endpoints of the test method are summarised in Table 2. This describes the so far tested biological applicability domain of the assay. Table 4: Signaling pathways studied in the test method.

However, it lacks specific details on where the test is likely to fail, how it reacts to mixtures and UVCBs, and which compound classes cannot be detected. It also does not address potential interference from compounds like fluorescent or colored chemicals. The answer is partially complete but lacks clarity and comprehensiveness in addressing all aspects of the question.","The assay reliably detects compounds that disrupt early neurodevelopmental endpoints—for example, chemicals known to interfere with migration and differentiation. In validation work and with positive controls, the assay correctly picked up known human developmental neurotoxicants such as methylmercury(II) chloride, cadmium chloride, hexachlorophene, and compounds that modulate pathways like SRC kinase inhibition (PP2), the action of EGF, or those that affect oligodendrocyte differentiation (BMP7) (Sources: ENV/CBC/MONO(2023)13, pp. 138–139).

In contrast, the assay is limited to early processes (migration/differentiation) of fetal neural progenitor cells and thus may fail to detect compounds that act only on later neurodevelopmental events (e.g. synaptogenesis, neuronal network formation) or that affect cells via pathways not represented (for example, neurotransmitters for which the receptors are not expressed or endocrine disruptors whose targets are absent) (Sources: ENV/CBC/MONO(2023)13, pp. 148–154). 

No specific information regarding mixtures and UVCBs is provided. However, the method requires chemicals to be sufficiently soluble in a suitable solvent. Volatile and highly lipophilic substances (including some UVCBs) are noted as potentially problematic and might require alternative exposure methods (e.g. passive dosing) or exclusion from testing (Sources: ENV/CBC/MONO(2023)13, pp. 152–154).

In terms of industry sectors and compound chemistry, the assay has been successfully applied to industrial chemicals, pesticides/biocides, cosmetic ingredients, and pharmaceuticals that are soluble in the established solvents. It is advisable to exclude compounds that cannot be reliably dissolved at non‐interfering solvent concentrations. Additionally, the assay warns that colored or fluorescent chemicals may interfere with the viability and cytotoxicity readouts, so such compounds are potential sources of artifactual results (Sources: ENV/CBC/MONO(2023)13, pp. 140–142; ""Uncertainties and troubleshooting"" sections).

In summary:
• The assay is likely to correctly pick up compounds that interfere with migration/differentiation (e.g. methylmercury, cadmium, hexachlorophene, PP2, EGF, BMP7).
• It is likely to miss compounds affecting later neurodevelopmental processes, neurotransmitters (if receptors are not present) or endocrine disruptors acting outside the modeled pathways.
• There is no detailed description on mixtures/UVCBs; however, solubility and handling issues (especially with volatile or highly lipophilic chemicals) mean such materials might be problematic.
• Compounds that are highly colored or fluorescent can interfere with assay readouts.

These points collectively define the assay’s applicability and its boundaries within the tested domains.",0.7687125846158598,0.09410408139228821,0.044848691672086716,0.07269325852394104
"Does the test fit into a test battery? If yes, into which test battery and are there any restrictions?

Compare performance to similar tests. Which gaps in a known or potential battery does the test method fill? Should the test preferentially be used in the first tier or later tiers, are complementary assays required or is it a stand-alone method?","To assess the hazard for developmental neurotoxicity it is recommended that this assay is used as one assay in a battery of assays (see 0 “Applicability of test methods”) For the assessment of chemical action on the endpoints represented by this test method, the test method can be used as stand-alone test method. The test method is currently used in the setup of a DNT test battery.",Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by indicating that the test can be part of a battery for developmental neurotoxicity and can also be used as a stand-alone method. However, it lacks details on specific strengths, weaknesses, comparisons to similar tests, gaps it fills, and tier preference, which are all aspects asked in the question.","The NPC2‑5 assay is not used as a stand‑alone method but rather as one component of an in vitro developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) test battery. According to the document, for a complete DNT assessment the assay should be integrated with complementary assays that cover endpoints the NPC2‑5 does not address (e.g., NPC proliferation, synaptogenesis, neuronal network formation, cortical layering, and astrocyte/microglia reactivity) (Source: NPC2‑5.pdf, p. 154).

Strengths of the NPC2‑5 assay within a battery include its human relevance (primary human neural progenitor cells derived from the fetal cortex), its ability to simultaneously assess multiple key endpoints (migration of radial glia, neurons, oligodendrocytes, differentiation, neurite outgrowth) and generate mechanistic insight. Its high content imaging-based readouts and medium throughput make it well suited for screening purposes and for confirming alerts raised by initial testing. Moreover, the assay provides good mechanistic follow‑up for effects on specific neurodevelopmental processes represented in the system (Source: NPC2‑5.pdf, p. 154–155).

However, weaknesses and restrictions are also noted. The assay is limited to early neurodevelopmental processes and does not capture later events such as synaptogenesis or network formation. In addition, because it covers a complex mixture of endpoints within a self‑organized system, inter‑experimental variability and differences between donor sources are inherent and require careful normalization and interpretation (Source: NPC2‑5.pdf, p. 153–154). These characteristics mean the assay should not be used as the sole test for DNT hazard but rather in combination with additional tests that assess gaps in the overall battery.

In summary, the NPC2‑5 assay fills a critical gap by providing mechanistic information on migration and differentiation during the fetal phase of neurodevelopment. It is most appropriate when used in a first‑tier or screening setting to flag potential neurodevelopmental toxicity and guide further mechanistic studies, while being complemented by assays covering endpoints that the NPC2‑5 does not address (Source: NPC2‑5.pdf, p. 154–157).",0.7604269605856696,0.18849971890449524,-0.08571572601795197,0.038557618856430054

1. Deviations from published descriptions  
 • Plate and consumables: In our current setup, 96‐well flat‐bottom plates are used that are pre‐coated with poly‐D‐lysine/laminin. Published protocols sometimes differ in the supplier of these plates and the coating procedure. For example, while earlier studies (e.g. Baumann et al., 2014) used similar coatings, our SOP specifies that coated plates must be stored for no longer than 7 days at 4°C and that outer wells are filled with water to reduce edge effects.  
 • Cell number and sphere size: Our method requires neurospheres of 0.25–0.35 mm in diameter (spheres generated from 1×10^6 hNPCs per vial), whereas some published descriptions (e.g. Moors et al., 2009) might have accepted slightly different size ranges, with adjustments for donor variability.  
 • Endpoint measurements: Our approach uses two measurement techniques: manual measurement of radial glia migration at 72 h (using ImageJ) and automated ICC image analysis (using the Omnisphero software) to determine endpoints such as neuronal migration, differentiation, neurite length, and neurite area at 120 h. In contrast, earlier protocols sometimes assessed migration endpoints (e.g. 24 h migration as reported by Jenny Baumann et al., 2016) or relied solely on manual measurement methods.  
 • Timing of readouts: In our protocol, migration is assessed both at 72 h (for radial glia migration) and at 120 h (for the full suite of endpoints). Some earlier studies may have used different timing—for example, a 24 h migration period has been reported in alternative exposure schemes.

However, it lacks clarity on whether the test method covers an AOP MIE/KE and does not refer to the status of the AOPs in the AOP-wiki, which is part of the question.","The NPC2-5 assay has been linked to AOPs. Specifically, the document states that the NPC2 endpoint is linked to the AOP “Disrupted laminin‑β1‑integrin interaction leading to developmental neurotoxicity” (which is part of an OECD project with ID1.83 and Coaching number C3‑#8), and that the NPC5 endpoint is linked to an AOP on the binding to voltage‐gated sodium channels leading to impaired behavioral function (Hernández‑Jerez et al., 2021). In these cases, the assay does not target the molecular initiating events (MIEs) directly but rather evaluates downstream key events (KEs) such as neural progenitor migration, differentiation, neurite outgrowth, and oligodendrocyte formation that are critical in these AOPs. 

Thus, the test method covers key event activations which are integral to the respective AOPs rather than serving as a direct assay of the MIE.

It merely references sections without detailing how the system reflects human biology or relevant tissue organization. The response lacks clarity and completeness in addressing the question.,"The mechanistic validation of the assay has been addressed on two complementary levels. On one hand, omics approaches were employed to analyze transcriptomic profiles of proliferating, three‐day differentiated, and five‐day differentiated hNPCs. This omics characterization identified key neurodevelopmental processes such as migration, neuronal differentiation, and glial differentiation, and it highlighted the activity of critical signaling pathways (e.g. BMP, Notch, and EGF signaling) that are known to regulate these processes in human brain development (Source: NPC2-5.pdf).

On the other hand, endpoint‐specific controls were implemented for mechanistic validation. For example, the SRC kinase inhibitor PP2 served as a positive control for radial glia migration (NPC2a), EGF was used to control neuronal differentiation (NPC3), and BMP7 served as a control for oligodendrocyte differentiation (NPC5). These controls not only validate the responsiveness of the endpoints but also reflect key signaling pathways relevant for human neurodevelopment by modulating specific cell migration and differentiation events (Source: NPC2-5.pdf).

Overall, the assay has been explored and shown to recapitulate human biology with respect to tissue organization and signaling relevant for neurodevelopmental toxicity. The use of primary human neural progenitor cells derived from fetal cortex, along with the observed morphological and functional similarities (e.g. radial glia migration mimicking in vivo corticogenesis), underscores the assay’s ability to model critical aspects of human neural tissue organization and signaling (Source: NPC2-5.pdf).",0.5496106678232665,0.05380876734852791,-0.17285798490047455,-0.06788033246994019
