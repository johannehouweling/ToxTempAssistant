The response is missing details on stability over passages and does not cover primary cells or microphysiological systems.","The initial cell acceptance criteria for the LUHMES cells in the MitoMetassay (UKN4b) include the following key points (Sources: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf):

1. Quality and Purity of the Cell Population:
 • The cells must be pathogen‐free, with regular testing for mycoplasma being performed after each thaw.  
 • Visual inspection is used to ensure the cells exhibit an oval morphology without excessive aggregation or clustering.  
 • The culture medium must be free of contamination indicators (e.g., it should not appear yellow).

2. Viability and Cell Death:
 • It is acceptable to see approximately 5–10% cell death (e.g., dead cells floating in the flask), whereas increased cell death—especially after a passage following thawing—necessitates discarding that cell batch.

3. Passage Number:
 • Only working stock cells up to passage 18 are considered valid to preserve cellular behavior.  
 • Consistency is ensured by thawing a new vial every 4 weeks and keeping the cell passage within the validated range.

4. Characterization and Identity:
 • The cells have been characterized by marker gene expression and by a short tandem repeat signature.  
 • Their origin (LUHMES cells derived from the ventral mesencephalon of an 8‐week-old human fetus) and dopaminergic phenotype (e.g., tyrosine hydroxylase expression under differentiation conditions) are verified.

5. Exclusion Criteria:
 • Cells exhibiting extensive clumping, markedly higher-than-normal cell death, or any signs of contamination (e.g., yellowed medium) are excluded from use.

Note: Although the question refers to iPSC maintenance and other primary cell considerations (such as pluripotency control or xenobiotic metabolism), this assay specifically utilizes LUHMES cells. Hence, control of pluripotency or metabolic functions for primary cells does not apply here. Instead, the focus is on ensuring the proper differentiation potential (neurite outgrowth, dopaminergic features) and stable cell behavior up to passage 18.

However, it lacks detail on critical consumables, batch effects, and specific handling steps. It also does not provide recommendations to increase reproducibility and performance, nor does it address special requirements for genetically-modified cells and microphysiological systems.","The documents identify several causes of variability in the source cells and recommend controls and best practices to enhance reproducibility:

1. Known causes of variability include:  
 • Inconsistencies in plastic coating – using different or sub‐optimal batches/brands of plastic ware, coating reagents (poly‐L-ornithine and fibronectin) or water quality can lead to uneven cell distribution, clumping, or aggregation.  
 • Differences in cell source and passage – cells from different working stock batches (or even from ATCC versus the University of Konstanz stock) may behave differently; higher passage numbers (beyond passage 18) also alter cell behavior.  
 • Cell density issues – seeding too few cells or permitting confluence above 90% (or below the minimum threshold of 40%) can impair subsequent differentiation and viability.  
 • Batch-to-batch variation in media and supplements – although the document does not explicitly mention FCS/serum replacement, analogous effects could be expected from changes in lots of other additives (e.g. growth factors, tetracycline) which are critical for the protocol.  

2. Critical consumables and handling factors include:  
 • Plate format and supplier – using recommended plastic ware and adhering to coating protocols is essential. Variability in plastic or different lots from other suppliers has been noted to cause issues.  
 • Coating reagents – consistent quality of poly-L-ornithine and fibronectin (prepared in ion‑exchanged, purified water) is critical. The plates should be washed appropriately (one wash with MilliQ water; no PBS) and used immediately rather than stored long-term in the fridge.  
 • Passage-specific issues – working stock cells should be used only up to passage 18; checking for markers is done on the stock, and only batches that meet the oval morphology criterion with <10% cell death should be used.  
 • Pipetting and seeding – careful, swift handling is required when trypsinizing and re-plating cells to avoid prolonged exposure at room temperature and to ensure even distribution. Using calibrated multichannel pipettes and minimizing delays during handling are both important.  

3. Special/additional requirements for genetically modified cells/microphysiological systems include:  
 • For the genetically modified LUHMES cells (with conditional v-myc expression), maintaining low passage number and checking morphology and viability are critical.  
 • Microphysiological systems (or cells in 3D or co-culture) would add further complexity regarding matrix chemistry and geometry as well as distribution between surface and core cells – although specific details are not provided here, one should standardize the microenvironment and handling conditions to reduce variability.  

4. Recommendations to improve reproducibility and performance:  
 • Use standardized protocols for cell maintenance, passage, and seeding density as specified (e.g. maintaining confluence above 40% but below 90%).  
 • Validate and consistently use the same batches of critical consumables (plastic ware, coating reagents, medium supplements, etc.).  
 • Train operators in multichannel pipetting and in rapid yet careful handling (especially during plating and coating steps) to minimize variability.  
 • Monitor cell morphology and viability closely—discard batches exhibiting excessive cell death or abnormal aggregate formation.  
 • Document and minimize any delays during medium changes, coating washes, and compound additions to ensure consistent cell handling.

The answer is partially complete but lacks clarity in some areas.","The differentiation protocol is based on a well‐defined timeline with specific medium changes and handling steps to convert proliferating LUHMES cells into post‑mitotic dopaminergic neurons. A simplified scheme is as follows (Sources: EFSA NAMs Case Study on Tebufenpyrad, Part 2 – Annex A, sections 3.6 and 4):

1. Pre‐differentiation (Day –1):  
 • Proliferating LUHMES cells are seeded in proliferation medium on plastic ware that has been pre‐coated with poly‑L‑ornithine (PLO) and fibronectin.  
 • The coating is done by incubating a solution of PLO (43 µg/ml) and fibronectin (1 µg/ml) overnight, followed by a wash and drying under sterile conditions.

2. Initiation of Differentiation (Day 0):  
 • The proliferation medium is completely replaced with differentiation medium.  
 • Differentiation medium contains tetracycline (1 µg/ml) to stop v‑myc expression, along with GDNF (2 ng/ml) and db‑cAMP (1 mM) to promote neuronal differentiation.  
 • This triggers the onset of neurite outgrowth and the initial development of the neuronal phenotype.

3. Pre‑treatment and Re-plating (Day 2):  
 • At this stage, cell numbers reach about 20–30 million per T75 flask.  
 • Cells are then trypsinized and re-plated into 96‑well plates at a density of 30,000 cells per well in 90 µl of differentiation medium that now uses galactose instead of glucose.  
 • The medium in these wells is deliberately formulated without cAMP and GDNF to prepare the system for compound exposure.  
 • Approximately 30 minutes to 2 hours after re‑plating, once cells (which appear round and not yet fully attached) are in place, compounds are added (10 µl each dilution).

4. Exposure and Readout (Day 3):  
 • After a total compound exposure of 24 hours (with the compound added on Day 2), cells are live‑stained with 1 µg/ml Hoechst H‑33342 and 1 µM calcein‑AM for 30 minutes.  
 • The assay then quantifies the neurite outgrowth (using calcein signal to detect neurite area) and cell viability (via nuclear counts in the Hoechst channel) using high‑content imaging.

For microphysiological systems or organoids, where additional factors such as cell printing, self‑aggregation or matrix interactions are important, extra steps such as employing 3D matrices, bioprinting techniques or geometrical characterization (size/shape analysis) would be required. However, for the MitoMet assay (UKN4b), the cells are cultured as a 2D monolayer with a stringent pre‑differentiation and re‑plating protocol (Source: EFSA NAMs Case Study on Tebufenpyrad, Part 2 – Annex A).

This protocol ensures that cell manipulations—media changes, re‑plating with defined densities, the use of specific substrates, and revised medium formulations—are all tightly controlled to drive efficient differentiation and to set the stage for compound‐induced neurotoxic effects to be evaluated reliably.",0.7832544039154896,0.14137907326221466,-0.07473350316286087,0.0267063956707716

Additional details extracted from the document are as follows:

1. Cells are maintained outside the experiment in proliferation medium and passaged every 2–3 days. For example, cells are counted at each passage and seeded at defined densities (e.g. 3 Mio per T75 flask for 2 days; see section 3.7 “Maintenance”).

2. Quality control and acceptance criteria for each cell batch include the following measures:  
 • Cells must be pathogen‐free (regular testing for mycoplasma is performed after thawing).  
 • Visual inspection is used to confirm that cells have an oval morphology without extensive aggregates; approximately 5–10% cell death (detected as floating cells) is acceptable (section 3.4 “Acceptance criteria for source cell population”).  
 • Working stock cells are only used up to passage 18 to maintain reproducible behavior.

3. The cell population used (LUHMES cells) represents a defined dopaminergic cell line derived from human mesencephalon. Although an explicit percentage (such as “95% Oct4‐positive” for iPSC, which is not applicable here) is not provided, the cells are characterized by their established phenotype (e.g. expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, α‑synuclein, and other neuronal markers) as detailed in sections 3.3 and 4.7.

4. The SOP specifies that only cells propagated from the working stock (prepared from an extensively expanded master stock brought from Lund in 2006) and kept under controlled passaging (up to passage 18) are suitable for testing. New vials (cell batches) are thawed approximately every 4 weeks (section 3.1 and 3.4).

5. Although the document does not explicitly state “GCCP” or “GIVIMP,” the described procedures—including rigorous cell culture conditions in S1 laboratories, documented maintenance schedules, and defined acceptance criteria—are in line with good cell culture practices expected for in vitro methods.

6. Frozen stocks and cell banks are prepared as follows:  
 • A master stock was generated (frozen in 2006) and, approximately every 4–5 years, a vial from this master stock is thawed and extensively expanded.  
 • These expanded cells are then frozen as working stock.  
 • For routine experiments, a new cell batch is thawed every 4 weeks from the working stock (section 3.1).

7. Since the test system is based on the established LUHMES cell line and not primary cells, no separate information on primary cell procurement or inclusion/exclusion criteria for primary cells is provided.

However, it lacks information on the percentage of contaminating cells, the percentage of each subpopulation in co-cultures, and whether specific chemicals show differential cytotoxicity for the cell sub-populations used. These omissions prevent a 'High' score.","The test system consists of human LUHMES cells that have been differentiated into dopaminergic neurons which are used as a 2D monolayer. In brief, proliferating LUHMES cells (seeded on plasticware pre‐coated with poly‑L‑ornithine and fibronectin) are first maintained in a proliferation medium. On day 0 the medium is changed to a differentiation medium that contains tetracycline (to shut down v‑myc expression), along with growth factors such as GDNF and db‑cAMP, to initiate differentiation. By day 2, when sufficient numbers and early neurite formation are evident, the cells (which typically have neurites roughly as long as their cell bodies) are trypsinized and replated into 96‑well plates in a galactose‐containing differentiation medium (without cAMP and GDNF). Approximately 30 minutes to 2 hours after plating, when the cells have just attached and still appear round, compound exposure is started. This sequential change in media and plating ensures that the cells continue differentiation and develop the neuronal network required for the assay’s endpoints (cell viability and neurite area) measured by high‑content imaging. _(Source: EFSA NAMs Case Study on Tebufenpyrad, Part 2 – Annex A, sections 3.6 and 4.1)_

Regarding additional technical manipulations, no collagen embedding, 3D structuring, or the use of mitotic inhibitors/hormones beyond those noted (tetracycline, GDNF, db‑cAMP) is described for the test system. Although LUHMES cells have been shown elsewhere to form 3D structures, in this assay they are used in a standard 2D monolayer.

No specific percentages for contaminating cells or defined cell subpopulations are reported in the document. The quality controls are based on visual inspection for appropriate morphology (e.g. an oval cell shape, minimal aggregate formation, and confluency around 60% at the start of treatment) and low cell death (<10% cell death is considered normal). In this assay the cells represent a relatively homogeneous population of differentiated dopaminergic neurons with no explicit co‑culture partners or subpopulations indicated.

Similarly, there is no information provided on whether subpopulations within the LUHMES culture display different sensitivities to cytotoxic insults or whether specific chemicals or chemical classes show differential cytotoxicity for particular subpopulations. The assay endpoints—neurite outgrowth and general viability—reflect the response of the overall cell population under the accepted criteria rather than any defined subpopulations. _(Sources: EFSA NAMs Case Study on Tebufenpyrad, Part 2 – Annex A, sections 3.6, 4.1, and 4.2)_",0.7481781124716025,0.20567190647125244,-0.042632512748241425,0.0719216838479042

However, it lacks detailed acceptance criteria, specific endpoints, analytical methods, and historical control data. The criteria are not quantified, and there is no mention of actions if acceptance criteria are not met.","The assay uses mainly morphological endpoints assessed by high‐content imaging at the start of the toxicity test. In particular, before treatment the cells are visually inspected for the following criteria (see Section 4.2 of MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf):

• The cells must display neurites that are approximately as long as the cell body when they are trypsinized for re‐plating.  
• A confluency of around 60% is expected on the plate.  
• At the moment of treatment the cells should not be fully attached yet and still appear round when viewed by microscope.  
• There must be no signs of contamination.

These endpoints are evaluated by staining with Hoechst (for nuclei) and calcein-AM (for viable cell morphology) and then assessing images acquired from the high‑content microscope. Although gene expression or PCR analyses may be done separately to characterize the differentiation status (as described elsewhere in the protocol), the immediate quality control at the start of the toxicity testing relies on these morphological and viability criteria. 

Historical experience shows that when the assay is performed repeatedly, batches that meet these visual/morphological acceptance criteria yield consistent neurite outgrowth and viability measures, while deviations (e.g. less neurite extension, altered attachment, or abnormal cell density) prompt discarding or repeating the experiment.

It provides vague criteria based on visual inspection without detailed parameters or actions if criteria are not met.","The test system is accepted based on both pre‑treatment and post‑treatment quality checks. Before treatment, when cells are trypsinized and replated (see section 4.2 of MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf):

• Cells must display differentiated characteristics: They should have neurites that are approximately as long as their cell body.  
• The culture should be clean (no contamination) and display the appropriate morphology (oval cells without extensive clumping or aggregates).  
• Cell density should be around 60% confluence at the time of treatment and, importantly, the cells should not be fully spread out yet (they appear round) because treatment occurs shortly after seeding.

After compound exposure (section 4.3):

• Negative controls must show that neurites are at least as long as the cell bodies.  
• The culture medium must retain its normal color (i.e. it should not become orange/yellow, which would indicate altered pH or metabolic stress).  
• An appropriate cell density is maintained.

In historical performance, the assay has been routinely run and—while no strict numeric “cut‐offs” for an individual run are provided—the system is expected to yield a DMSO control neurite area of at least 35,000 (see section 5.9) and, for example, a positive control (narciclasine) that reduces neurite area to 75% or less of the DMSO control while viability remains ≥90%. Experiments that fall outside these expectations (for instance, a markedly reduced neurite length or an improper cell density) are discarded as failed runs.

If the acceptance criteria are not met—for example, if the average neurite length in the negative controls is substantially below the typical appearance (e.g. if neurites appear very short relative to the cell body) or if there is visible contamination or improper confluency—the experiment is not used in data analysis, and cells are either re‐cultured (or a new working stock is thawed) to ensure that only cells meeting the quality criteria are used.

However, it lacks clarity and completeness in some areas. It does not explicitly mention critical handling steps, positive and negative controls, or provide specific recommendations to increase reproducibility and performance. The answer could be improved by including these missing elements and providing more detailed guidance on handling and control measures.","Below are the key points extracted from the document:

1. Causes of variability in the final test system include:  
 • Variability in plastic ware and coating steps – differences in PLO/fibronectin batches, water quality, and even differences between lots or suppliers of plates can influence uniform cell distribution and attachment.  
 • Cell batch and passage variability – cells from different working stock vials, increased passage numbers (use only up to passage 18) and differences arising from “cell lot” or “cell batch” can alter cell behavior and morphology.  
 • Medium and supplement batch effects – although a serum replacement isn’t explicitly mentioned, variability in base medium and additive quality (e.g. FGF, tetracycline, db-cAMP, or GDNF if used) can affect differentiation and viability.  

2. Critical handling steps and influencing factors:  
 • Pipetting – Use a multichannel/multistepper pipette with care. Add compounds with pipette tips touching the well’s wall just above the medium surface; improper pipetting (e.g. releasing droplets too high above the medium) may lead to droplets clinging to the wall.  
 • Timing – Steps such as medium change, cell seeding, and compound addition should be performed quickly to minimize time at room temperature and avoid delays in cell attachment.  
 • Cell density – Maintain a confluency of about 60% at the start of treatment. Too low or too high cell density (target 40–90% for maintenance) can impair differentiation and metabolism.  

3. Positive and negative controls and their expected values:  
 • Positive control: Narciclasine (50 nM final concentration). Expected to reduce neurite area to ≤75% of the DMSO (negative) control while keeping viability ≥90% of control.  
 • Negative control: Solvent control (typically 0.1% DMSO) should yield a neurite area of at least 35,000 (arbitrary units) with maintained viability.  
 • Within-run variability: Typical intra-experimental baseline variation is ~11.7 ±4.5% for neurite outgrowth and ~3.8 ±3.5% for cell viability. Inter-experimental variability is around 15.3% for neurite outgrowth and 4.3% for viability.  
 • Positive control variation may show neurite outgrowth values from 20% up to 60% of control, reflecting the dynamic range of responses.  
     
4. Recommendations to increase/ensure reproducibility and performance:  
 • Standardize consumables – use the same, validated batches of coating reagents (PLO and fibronectin) and consistent plastic ware from the same supplier/lot.  
 • Carefully control cell culture conditions – monitor cell density, confluency, and passage number strictly; use only cells from validated working stocks.  
 • Optimize and standardize pipetting procedures – train operators to use consistent technique for seeding, medium changes, and compound addition (preferably with a calibrated multichannel pipette).  
 • Use only the inner 60 wells of a 96‑well plate to reduce edge effects, and fill edge wells with PBS/MilliQ water.  
 • Document and monitor experimental conditions – record plate maps, reagent batch numbers, and any pipetting errors to identify possible sources of variability.  
 • Include positive (narciclasine) and negative (0.1% DMSO) controls on each plate and regularly review variation in baseline conditions (intra‑ and inter‑experimental variability) to ensure assay performance remains within accepted limits.

For example, a microarray‐based transcriptome analysis was performed comparing differentiated LUHMES cells at day 3 (end of the UKN4 exposure period) and day 6 with the undifferentiated cells. In addition, a complete transcriptome dataset covering LUHMES differentiation from day 2 to day 10 is available from the EBI database under the accession ID S-TOXR1833 (public as of March 2022). Epigenetic modifiers have also been characterized (see Weng et al., 2014) and further gene expression profiles relevant to Alzheimer’s disease (Scholz et al., 2011) and neuronal receptor composition (Loser et al., 2020; Loser et al., 2021) have been reported.

Give information on where the test system differs from the mimicked human tissue and which gaps of analogy need to be considered.,"- As neurons of the central nervous system they express the dopamine transporter DAT - Cells grow axons and neurites in course of their differentiation - They express various neuronal transporters and receptors (e.g. purinergic receptors, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Loser et al., 2020) - They are electrophysiologically active and excitable, produce action potentials (Loser et al., 2020)",Low,The answer provides characteristics of the test system but does not address how it differs from the mimicked human tissue or identify specific gaps of analogy that need to be considered.,"The in vitro test system only partially mimics key features of the human brain’s dopaminergic system. On one hand, the LUHMES cells differentiate into neurons that express markers like DAT and TH, extend neurites, and even show electrophysiological activity—features that represent central aspects of human dopaminergic neurons (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, Sections 3.2 and 4.7). However, several gaps must be kept in mind when translating these results to the in vivo situation:

• The assay is performed in a simplified 2D environment that lacks the full three‐dimensional architecture and the complex extracellular matrix present in human brain tissue.  
• Although the cells become post-mitotic, they originate from an immortalized cell line (via conditional v-myc expression), so their maturation and synaptic connectivity (with synapse formation not fully established) may not fully replicate mature neuronal networks found in vivo.  
• The standard culture conditions do not routinely include the complete repertoire of supporting glial cells and other cell–cell interactions that modulate neuronal function in human tissue.  
• Metabolic conditions are experimentally manipulated (e.g. switching to galactose-based medium) to increase sensitivity to mitochondrial toxicants, which may further diverge from the normal metabolic state in the human brain.

These considerations highlight that while the assay captures several key neuronal features, its simplified nature means that caution is needed when extrapolating the findings to the complexity of human brain tissue (Sources: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, Sections 3.2, 4.7, and 8.6).",0.5976927512858983,0.19552035629749298,-0.08479242026805878,0.04182543605566025

Additional details extracted from the document are as follows:

1. Basic Cell Propagation and Maintenance  
• LUHMES cells are maintained in proliferation medium and passaged every 2–3 days (see section 3.7). For splitting, defined seeding numbers are used (e.g. 3 Mio cells per T75 flask for 2 days, or 1 Mio per T75 flask for 3 days).  
• Cells are cultured in standard conditions and are kept at confluencies between 40% and 85% to prevent stress.  
_(Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_

2. Purity of the Cell Population  
• The document describes detailed characterization of LUHMES cells. While no explicit percentage value (e.g. “95% Oct4-positive”) is provided for purity, the cells are morphologically defined to be of oval shape, with minimal clustering, and marker expression is regularly checked (e.g. for dopaminergic features such as TH expression, and others in section 3.3).  
_(Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_

3. Quality Control Measures and Acceptance Criteria  
• Source cells must be pathogen-free (regular mycoplasma testing) and inspected visually upon thawing.  
• Acceptance criteria include an oval morphology with less than extensive aggregation, approximately 5–10% cell death being acceptable, and clear visual inspection of culture medium (e.g. it should not turn yellow).  
• Working stocks are used only up to passage 18 to assure cell functionality.  
_(Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_

4. Passages Used in the Test  
• Cells are expanded from a frozen masterstock. Working stocks are generated from a vial of the masterstock every 4–5 years, and a new cell batch (vial) is thawed every 4 weeks from the working stock with usage up to passage 18, while cells are cultured until passage 20.  
_(Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_

5. Adherence to Good Practice Guidelines  
• Although the document does not explicitly state “GCCP” or “GIVIMP”, the maintenance and experimental procedures are executed in accordance with established standard operating procedures that imply compliance with good cell culture practices and in vitro method practices.  
_(Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_

6. Duration of Use for the Same Cell Batch  
• Working stock cells (derived from the masterstock) are used up to passage 18. A new vial from the working stock is typically thawed every 4 weeks to ensure optimal cell performance.

The description is somewhat clear but not fully comprehensive.","Below is a graphical/text timeline for the entire culture and exposure scheme of the MitoMet assay (UKN4b):

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
Day -1:  
• Cells: Proliferating LUHMES cells are used.  
• Coating: Culture flasks/plates are pre-coated overnight with poly‑L‑ornithine (43 µg/ml) and fibronectin (1 µg/ml).  
• Action: LUHMES cells are seeded in proliferation medium.  
(Source: Sections 3.6 and 4.1)

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
Day 0:  
• Medium Change: The proliferation medium is completely replaced with differentiation medium.  
• Critical Supplements: Differentiation medium contains tetracycline (1 µg/ml) to shut down v‑myc expression, along with db‑cAMP (1 mM) and GDNF (2 ng/ml) to promote neuronal differentiation.  
• Cells: At this stage, cells are still in a proliferative state transitioning to differentiation.  
(Source: Sections 3.6 and 4.1)

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
Day 2:  
• Cell Density: LUHMES cells reach approximately 20–30 million per T75 flask.  
• Re-plating: Cells are trypsinized and re-plated into 96‑well plates at 30,000 cells per well in 90 µl of differentiation medium.  
• Medium Change & Compound Setup: The differentiation medium used now is based on galactose (instead of glucose) and is prepared without db‑cAMP and GDNF. This adaptation enhances sensitivity to mitochondrial toxicants.  
• Compound Addition: Approximately 30 minutes to 2 hours after seeding (once cells have attached but remain round), 10 µl of compound dilution is added to each well (resulting in a total volume of 100 µl). Note that compounds are added only once—there is no re‑addition during subsequent medium changes.  
(Source: Sections 4.1 and 5.1)

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
Day 3:  
• Exposure Duration: Cells are exposed to the compounds for a total of 24 hours (from the time of compound addition on Day 2).  
• Sampling & Staining: Approximately 23.5 hours post compound addition, the cells are incubated for 30 minutes with live‑cell stains—1 µg/ml Hoechst H‑33342 (to label all nuclei) and 1 µM calcein‑AM (to mark viable cells).  
• Readout: After the 24‑hour exposure (including the staining period), the cells are imaged using a high‑content microscope (Cellomics Array Scan VTI).

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
Summary of Key Points:  
– The assay starts with proliferating, freshly seeded cells on coated vessels.  
– A single medium change on Day 0 transitions cells into differentiation, supplemented with tetracycline, GDNF, and db‑cAMP.  
– On Day 2, cells are re-plated into 96‑well plates using a galactose‐based differentiation medium (without cAMP and GDNF), and compounds are added after cells attach.  
– No further re‑addition of compounds takes place even if a medium change might be needed; the exposure is maintained for 24 hours up to the live‐cell readout on Day 3.  
– Critical medium supplements include tetracycline (in Day 0 medium) and the change from glucose‑containing to galactose‑based medium (on Day 2), which is essential for detecting mitochondrial toxicants.

Co-staining with 1 µg/ml Hoechst H-33342 allows the identification of any cell. Cells are stained for 30 min at 37°C and 5% CO2 in the incubator. The cell staining is imaged in a Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS reader. Hoechst H-33342 staining is imaged in channel 1 (UV-Hoechst); calcein staining is imaged in channel 2 (Green-FITC). Exposure times are set manually. To measure the neurite area, the software acquires the Hoechst signal in channel 1 to identify the cells as objects (via identification of the nuclei), and the calcein-AM signal in channel 2 to measure neurite area. Double positive cells are counted as viable.",Medium,"The answer provides a partial overview of the analytical method, including staining procedures and imaging details. However, it lacks a comprehensive description of the method's principles and key steps, such as whether cells are fixed or homogenized. It also does not address whether viability and neurite outgrowth are measured in the same well or independently. The explanation of the quantification algorithm is minimal, and there is no mention of the number of cells imaged.","The analytical approach relies on live-cell imaging of differentiated LUHMES neurons in 96‐well plates to capture two endpoints—neurite outgrowth and viability—in the same well and under identical conditions. On day 3 (approximately 24 hours after toxicant exposure), cells are live‐stained with two fluorescent dyes: Hoechst H‑33342 labels nuclei and calcein‑AM stains the cytoplasm of viable cells. The cells are not fixed or homogenized, meaning that all measurements are performed on intact, living cells.

Images are acquired using a high-content microscope (Cellomics Array Scan) with a 20× objective over approximately ten fields per well, ensuring that a representative number of cells (hundreds per well) are included in the analysis. In one imaging channel, the Hoechst signal is used to detect individual nuclei. Using a machine-learning–based algorithm, the nuclear outlines are identified and then expanded by a defined distance (3.2 µm) to generate a virtual cell soma area. In parallel, the calcein‑positive signal is recorded in another channel, where all calcein-positive structures are quantified. The neurite area is calculated by subtracting the soma region (defined by the expanded nuclear outlines) from the total calcein-positive area.

Viability is determined by evaluating the intensity of the calcein signal within the virtual cell soma areas, where only nuclei with a positive calcein signal, based on preset intensity thresholds, are counted as viable cells. This simultaneous measurement provides a parallel readout of both neurite outgrowth (as an indicator of neuronal connectivity) and cell viability in the same cells and wells.

"Provide information on machine settings, analytical standards, data processing and normalization procedures. For imaging endpoints: provide detailed algorithm. This information should also be covered in an SOP, preferably in DB-ALM format (see link in 6.6).","Quantification of neurite outgrowth An automated microplate reading microscope (Array-ScanII HCS Reader, Cellomics, PA) equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera (resolution 1024 x 1024; run at 2 x 2 binning) was used for image acquisition. Ten fields per well were imaged. Images were recorded in 2 channels using a 20x objective and excitation/emission wavelengths of 365 ± 50/535 ± 45 to detect H-33342 in channel 1 and 474 ± 40/535 ± 45 to detect calcein in channel 2. In both channels, a fixed exposure time and an intensity histogram-derived threshold were used for object identification. Neurite pixels were identified using the following image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified as objects in channel 1 according to their size, area, shape, and intensity which were predefined on untreated cells using a machine-based learning algorithm, and manual selection of nuclei to be classified as intact. The nuclear outlines were expanded by 3.2 µm in each direction, to define a virtual cell soma area (VCSA) based on the following procedure: The average width of the cytoplasm ring (distance nucleus - cell membrane) of LUHMES cells was experimentally determined to be 2.3 µm. Size irregularities were not always due to growing neurites, as determined by combined F-actin/tubulin beta-III staining. To avoid scoring of false positive neurite areas, the exclusion ring (VCSA) was made bigger than the average cell size. Then, we used two control compounds (U0126 and bisindolylmaleimid I) to vary the expanded outlines from 0.6 to 4 µm. We found 3.2 µm to be optimal both to detect neurite growth over time and to identify reduced neurite growth with high sensitivity. All calcein-positive pixels of the field (beyond a given intensity threshold) were defined as viable cellular structures (VCSs). The threshold was dynamically determined for each field after flat field and background correction and intensity normalization to 512 gray values and was set to12% of the maximal brightness (channel 63 of 512). The VCS defines the sum of all somata and neurites without their assignment to individual cells. In an automatic calculation, the VCSAs, defined in the H- 33342 channel, were used as filter in the calcein channel and subtracted from the VCS. The remaining pixels (VCS - VCSA) in the calcein channel were defined as neurite area. Quantification of individual viable cells by imaging For a quantitative assessment of viable cells, the same images used to assess neurite area were analysed using another image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified in channel 1 as objects according to their size, area, shape, and intensity. Nuclei of apoptotic cells with increased fluorescence were excluded. A VCSA was defined around each nucleus by expanding it by 0.3 µm into each direction. Calcein-AM staining, labelling live cells, was detected in channel 2. The algorithm quantified the calcein intensity in the VCSA areas. Cells having an average calcein signal intensity in the VCSAs below a predefined threshold were classified by the program as “not viable”. Valid nuclei with a positive calcein signal in their cognate VCSA were counted as viable cells. A positive calcein signal was based on measurements of the average intensity (normal cells: 1300 ± 115, threshold: < 50) and the total integrated intensity (normal cells: 186,000 ± 23,600, threshold < 1000) of cells.",Medium,"The answer provides detailed information on the imaging equipment, settings, and algorithms used for neurite outgrowth quantification and viable cell assessment. However, it lacks information on analytical standards, data processing, and normalization procedures beyond the imaging context. Additionally, there is no mention of an SOP or reference to the DB-ALM format as requested in the question.","The assay uses an automated high‐content imaging system with clearly defined machine settings, data processing procedures, and an imaging endpoint algorithm that is also documented in the DB‑ALM SOP (see section 6.6).

Machine settings and analytical standards:
• The imaging is performed using a Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS Reader equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA‑ER camera running at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels and 2 × 2 binning. A 20× objective is used.
• Two channels are set up: channel 1 detects Hoechst H‑33342 (excitation 365 ± 50 nm; emission 535 ± 45 nm) for nuclei identification, and channel 2 detects calcein-AM (excitation around 474 ± 40 nm; emission 535 ± 45 nm) for marking viable cells.
• Exposure times are set manually, and an intensity histogram‑derived threshold is applied for object identification. For the calcein channel, after flat‐field and background correction an intensity normalization to 512 gray values is performed and a dynamic threshold is set at 12% of the maximal brightness.
• Analytical standards include running well‐established positive (e.g. narciclasine, HA‑1077, blebbistatine) and negative (0.1% DMSO) controls. These standards ensure that the imaging and readout parameters (i.e. neurite area and cell count) fall within defined acceptance ranges.

Data processing and normalization procedures:
• Raw images are acquired with the Array Scan hardware and then processed using the Array Scan software. The software identifies objects and quantifies endpoints (neurite area and cell number).
• Data are copied and collated in Excel files. Further analysis and curve fitting (using a four‑parameter log function via least squares regression) are carried out in GraphPad Prism and with additional tools such as BMCeasy.
• For normalization, readouts (neurite area, cell counts, and viability levels) are usually expressed relative to solvent (0.1% DMSO) controls. Any concentration‐response curves are generated on these normalized data.

Detailed imaging endpoint algorithm:
1. Nuclei Identification (Channel 1):
 • Objects (nuclei) are identified based on predefined criteria (size, area, shape, intensity) that have been optimized on untreated controls using a machine‑learning algorithm.
2. Definition of Virtual Cell Soma Area (VCSA):
 • For neurite quantification, each identified nucleus is expanded by 3.2 µm in all directions. This “exclusion ring” (VCSA) is chosen after optimization with control compounds to avoid scoring false positive neurite pixels.
3. Identification of Viable Cellular Structures (VCS) using Calcein Signal (Channel 2):
 • All calcein-positive pixels (above the dynamically determined intensity threshold) are summed to generate the VCS. These pixels represent both cell bodies and neurites.
4. Neurite Area Calculation:
 • The VCSA (predominantly representing the cell body) is subtracted from the VCS. The remaining pixels are attributed to neurites, and their summed area is quantified as the neurite endpoint.
5. Quantification of Viable Cells:
 • An additional algorithm quantifies viability by again detecting nuclei (with slight expansion by 0.3 µm to form a VCSA specific for viability measurement) and then assessing the average calcein signal intensity in these areas. Cells with integrated intensities below predefined thresholds (average intensity <50 and total intensity <1000, based on normal cell values) are classified as non‐viable.

3. Blebbistatin  
 • Why MCC: Blebbistatin inhibits myosin II activity, which is involved in actomyosin contraction. Inhibition of this pathway favors neurite extension.  
 • Expected Data: An enhancement of neurite outgrowth (increased neurite area) with no significant reduction in cell viability.  
 • Pathway Effect: Inhibition of myosin II leads to reduced cytoskeletal tension, facilitating neurite outgrowth, which correlates with a positive test response.  
  (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, section 5.5)

Additional candidates that have been explored in early experiments include microtubule‐disrupting agents such as colchicine, vincristine, and nocodazole. These compounds also inhibit neurite outgrowth by interfering with microtubule dynamics. However, for routine day-to-day performance monitoring, the above three compounds—narciclasine (decreasing neurite area) and HA‑1077/blebbistatin (increasing neurite area)—are preferred because their effects on the underlying Rho/ROCK/myosin II pathway provide consistent and robust changes in the neurite outgrowth endpoint.

Overall, there is a clear correlation between pathway modulation and test method response: activation of the Rho pathway (by narciclasine) leads to reduced neurite growth, whereas inhibition of its downstream effectors (via HA‑1077 or blebbistatin) promotes neurite extension.

What chemicals/manipulations are used as positive controls? Describe the expected data on such controls (signal and its uncertainty)? How good are in vivo reference data on the positive controls? Are in vivo relevant threshold concentrations known?,Positive control: narciclasine (50 nM final concentration),Low,"The answer only provides the name and concentration of the positive control chemical, narciclasine, but does not describe the expected data on such controls, the signal and its uncertainty, the quality of in vivo reference data, or the in vivo relevant threshold concentrations. It lacks completeness and relevance to the question.","Positive controls in the assay include narciclasine (applied at 50 nM as a positive control for neurite growth inhibition) along with additional mechanistic controls such as HA‑1077 (a Rho‐associated kinase inhibitor that enhances neurite growth) and blebbistatin (which inhibits myosin II). These controls act via pathways involved in cytoskeletal dynamics (e.g. the Rho/ROCK/LIM kinase/cofilin pathway).

Regarding the expected data, the assay is designed so that treatment with narciclasine should result in a neurite area that is no more than 75% of that observed in the DMSO control, while cellular viability remains at or above 90% of control levels. In practice, across 36 plates in 12 independent runs, the neurite area in narciclasine‐treated wells has been observed to vary between 40% and 75% of control (with cell viability maintained consistently above 90%). This variability has been quantified in inter‐experimental measures; for example, if a positive control on average reduces the neurite area to 40% of the solvent control with an estimated variability of around 50% of the mean value, the resultant range might be approximately ±20% (i.e. a mean of 40% can vary roughly between 20% and 60%).

There is, however, only limited information regarding in vivo reference data for these positive control chemicals. The documents do not provide extensive in vivo threshold concentrations or detailed in vivo reference data for narciclasine or the other mechanistic controls, so in vivo relevant threshold concentrations are not known from the available sources.

(Such data define the background noise of the test method) What is the rationale for the concentration setting of negative controls? Do you use unspecific controls? If yes, indicate the compounds and the respective rationale for their use and the concentration selection.","Negative control: solvent (0.1% DMSO final concentration), mannitol, paracetamol, ASS, galloflavin.",Low,"The answer lists some chemicals used as negative controls but does not describe the expected data on such controls, the rationale for concentration settings, or whether unspecific controls are used. It lacks clarity and completeness in addressing the question.","Negative controls in this assay are primarily based on the solvent control using 0.1% DMSO. In addition, unspecific controls are employed, which include compounds such as mannitol, paracetamol, ASS, and galloflavin. 

For the solvent (DMSO) control the expected outcome is a high background signal with a neurite area of at least 35,000 arbitrary units and no significant reduction in cell viability. Baseline variations in the assay have been quantified as an intra-experimental coefficient of variation of about 11.7 ± 4.5% for neurite outgrowth and 3.8 ± 3.5% for cell viability. These figures reflect the natural variability (“background noise”) of the test system under negative control conditions.

The rationale behind setting the negative control concentration (0.1% DMSO) is to use the minimal solvent concentration required to dissolve test compounds while ensuring that the solvent itself does not influence the assay endpoints. This “background” level allows for reliable identification of compound-induced effects. 

Unspecific controls are used to differentiate general cytotoxicity from specific effects on neurite outgrowth. Compounds like mannitol, paracetamol, ASS, and galloflavin are chosen because they are not expected to specifically impair neurite development but may affect general viability if applied at inappropriate concentrations. Their concentrations are selected such that, when combined with the DMSO vehicle (maintained at 0.1%), any observed changes can be attributed to unspecific toxic effects rather than a specific perturbation of neurite outgrowth.

It mentions sensitivity to toxicants and a method to increase sensitivity, but it does not discuss apoptosis sensitivity or resistance, cytotoxicity in minor subpopulations, specific cell populations' sensitivity, markers, issues distinguishing slowed proliferation from cell death, considerations for repeated dosing, or delayed measures of cytotoxicity.","No explicit information is provided in the document regarding differential apoptosis sensitivity or resistance. The assay is designed for differentiated LUHMES neurons—a relatively homogeneous, post‐mitotic population—and focuses on quantifying neurite outgrowth (the main endpoint) and overall cell viability using calcein-AM and Hoechst H‑33342 staining. (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, Sections 5.1–5.4)

In this context, the protocol does not address whether cytotoxicity is hard to capture in any minor subpopulations, as the test system is not a multicellular mixture but a largely uniform population of dopaminergic neurons derived from LUHMES cells. There is also no discussion of one particular subpopulation being more sensitive or of using distinct specific markers for different cellular subpopulations beyond the general markers for dopaminergic identity (e.g., tyrosine hydroxylase, DAT) that are noted in the system description. (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, Sections 3.3 and 4.7)

Because the cells are in a differentiation stage and are post-mitotic at the point of testing, the issue of distinguishing slowed proliferation from cell death is minimal; the assay’s viability readout is not confounded by proliferation rates. (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, Sections 4.1–4.3)

Furthermore, the protocol describes a 24‐hour toxicant exposure period, and there is no indication that early death with subsequent compensatory growth is considered for repeated or prolonged dosing scenarios. Similarly, for very short‐term endpoints (such as electrophysiology measured 30 minutes after exposure), the assay does not provide a delayed measure of cytotoxicity; rather, cytotoxic effects are assessed only after a full 24‐hour treatment period.

Indicate actions if the AC are not met.,"These were developed in the UKN4 assay and, due to the high similarity of the assays, are applied unchanged in the UKN4b assay. Positive control narciclasine: Neurite area ≤ 75% of DMSO control Viability ≥ 90% of DMSO control (or not significantly changed) Negative control DMSO: Neurite area ≥ 35’000",Medium,"The answer provides specific criteria for positive and negative controls, which partially addresses the question about the rule applied to test performance. However, it lacks clarity on how the decision is documented and does not specify actions if acceptance criteria (AC) are not met.","The assay run’s validity is judged by confirming that its control values meet all the pre‐defined acceptance criteria. For instance, a normal performance run is expected to show that:

• The negative (solvent/DMSO) control produces a neurite area of at least 35,000 (as outlined in section 5.9 Acceptance Criteria for the Test Method), and  
• The positive control (narciclasine at 50 nM) demonstrates a reduction of the neurite area to ≤75% of the DMSO control while maintaining cell viability at ≥90% of the control.

These criteria are checked by comparing the measured endpoints for each test run against these benchmarks. The decision is documented by recording the plate maps, control endpoint values (neurite area and viability), and any deviations in the lab book and corresponding Excel files (sections 7.1 and 7.2 detail how raw data and outliers are managed).

If the acceptance criteria (AC) are not met (for example, if the DMSO control falls below the required neurite area or the positive control does not show the expected reduction), the affected run is flagged. In such cases, troubleshooting is initiated (e.g. checking coating quality, cell density, or pipetting accuracy) and the test run is either repeated using the same cell batch or, if issues persist (such as a high cell death rate or poor differentiation), the batch may be discarded and a new working stock thawed.

However, it does not clearly address the possibility or extent of repeated measures over time from the same dish, which is part of the question. The explanation is somewhat complex and could be clearer in terms of how repeated measures are handled.","Based on the throughput information in section 5.10 of the MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf document, the original calculation assumed 6 plates per day, 3 days per week, and 4 weeks per month yielding 1,200 data points per month. Here, each data point is defined as one concentration (with its technical replicates merged into a single point), and calibration controls are not counted. When we count only three working weeks per month rather than four, the calculation becomes:

  6 plates/day × 3 days/week = 18 plates/week  
  Each plate contributes a set number of data points (derived from 5 compounds × 10 concentrations = 50 data points per full replicate set), but since the throughput was stated as 100 data points per day in the original estimate, the revised monthly total is:  
  100 data points/day × 3 days/week × 3 weeks/month = 900 real data points per month.

Regarding repeated measures over time from the same dish, the standard protocol conducts a single imaging endpoint after 24 hours of compound exposure (day 3) and does not include repeated time‐course measurements on the same dish. Although the protocol mentions that variations are possible (for example, doing a washout and acquiring an additional readout on day 4 or later to assess a more mature neurite network), in the standard setup only one measurement per dish is performed.

Thus, under the standard conditions (with technical replicates counted as one and excluding control wells), the assay yields approximately 900 real data points per month, and repeated measures (time-course readouts from the same dish) are not performed routinely.

Additionally, it does not fully address how the final addition to the test system takes place or provide details on the compartmentalization of cultures.","The protocol describes the following procedure regarding compound preparation and handling (Sources: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf – Sections 6.1 and 6.4):

1. Compound stocks are prepared from solid (powder) material by dissolving them in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The preferred solvent is DMSO, which is stored in a light‐proof, air‑tight bottle at room temperature. Once dissolved, the solutions are aliquoted in volumes sufficient for one complete experiment (i.e. one biological replicate) in order to avoid repeated freeze–thaw cycles that could compromise compound stability and activity.

2. For use in an experiment, one aliquot is thawed and subsequently diluted in a deepwell plate. The diluent is Advanced DMEM/F12 (without supplements) or, in the case of the galactose medium used from day 2 onward, that medium is used (see Section 3.6 for media details). All dilutions are made in the presence of 1% DMSO so that when 10 µl of the diluted compound is added to 90 µl of cell suspension in the 96‑well plate, the final concentration of DMSO on the cells becomes 0.1%.

3. The serial dilution of the compound is typically prepared in the deepwell plate—using a serial dilution factor (default is 1:3, although narrower dilution steps such as 1:1.5 can be applied if needed). In the highest concentration, the dilution is done 1:100 with medium free of DMSO because the initial aliquot already brings in the solvent up to 1% in the diluted series.

4. No explicit mention is made of filtering the stock or dilution solutions for sterility. (If sterility is needed, this is not described in the provided context.)

5. For the final addition, once LUHMES cells are replated into 96‑well plates in 90 µl of galactose-based differentiation medium (without tetracycline, db‑cAMP, and GDNF) on day 2, the compounds are added 30 minutes to 2 hours later – after the cells have attached. A multichannel‐multistepper pipette (using 6 filter tips at a time) is used to dispense 10 µl of each compound dilution into the wells. This achieves a final volume of 100 µl per well.

6. The compound addition is therefore performed in the inner wells of the 96‑well plate (edge wells are filled with PBS/MilliQ water to avoid edge effects) and always after the cells have been re‑plated and allowed a brief attachment period. The procedure does not indicate that compound addition is done in a separate compartment but rather directly into the cell suspension in each well.

Other details such as specific volumes and pipetting speeds are defined: the instrument settings use “medium” speed for uptake and “high” speed for output during pipetting. Temperature or lighting conditions during compound preparation are not further detailed except that DMSO storage is light-protected and that compounds are thawed immediately prior to dilution.

This overview summarizes the volumes, lab ware (deepwell plates and 96‑well plates), instruments (multichannel‑multistepper pipette with filter tips), choice and role of DMSO as solvent, and how the serial dilutions are prepared and finally added to the test system (Sources: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf – Sections 6.1 and 6.4).",0.8571642999463795,0.30302929878234863,0.11098404973745346,0.20303016901016235

It also does not mention the inclusion of detailed information in an SOP or the DB-ALM format.","The protocol requires that the pipetting schedule is pre‐planned and documented before the experiment starts. In practice, the pipetting time plan is established by using a predefined schedule that is coordinated with the availability of the high‐content microscope and cell supply. This schedule, along with the plate maps (which indicate the exact locations of compounds and controls), is prepared and recorded in both a paper lab book and in Excel files stored on a shared work group server (Sources: 6.2, 6.3).

During the actual pipetting process, adherence to the plate maps is ensured as the experimenter proceeds from left to right – starting with the highest concentration in the left column. Any deviation or pipetting error (for instance, accidentally pipetting twice into a well) is immediately marked directly on the plate map and simultaneously noted in the paper lab book in the cell culture room. These documented notes ensure that any intermediate step with potential errors, mistakes or uncertainties is transparently recorded (Sources: 6.2, 6.3).

In addition, a detailed standard operating procedure is available that describes these practices in a step‐by‐step manner. This SOP is provided in the DB‑ALM format (see link in section 6.6) and includes instructions on how to prepare, perform, and document all aspects of compound dilution, pipetting, and error documentation. This helps to ensure that any technical issue is documented (e.g. pipetting errors, such as adding twice to one well) and that the use of plate wells follows the defined sequential pattern (left-to-right order within each technical replicate).

Thus, the time plan, pipetting sequence, and error logging are tightly integrated into the lab’s documentation routine via pre-defined plate maps, lab books, and electronic spreadsheets that are maintained as part of the official DB‑ALM SOP.

However, it lacks details on rules for defining starting dilutions and how test concentrations are defined for functional endpoints that may not provide full concentration-response. Additionally, there is no mention of an SOP or DB-ALM format as requested.","The assay applies a serial dilution approach to define the concentration range. By default, test compounds are diluted in a 1:3 series covering 10 different concentrations (for example, from approximately 20 µM down to 1 nM, yielding a 19,683‐fold range) (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, section 6.4). The highest compound concentration is initially diluted 1:100 with medium (without additional DMSO) such that when 10 µl of the compound dilution are added to 90 µl already on the well, the final DMSO level is 0.1% (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, section 6.4). 

Furthermore, the dilution factor is adaptable—a narrower dilution such as 1:1.5 can be used if needed. In situations where functional endpoints (like gene expression) do not provide a full concentration-response, the highest tested concentration (HTC) is used for analysis; for example, if the viability endpoint does not reach the benchmark concentration (e.g. BMC25) required for ratio calculations, the HTC serves as the reference value (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, section 8.3).

It also describes known pitfalls and potential operator mistakes, providing a complete and relevant response.","Several issues have been identified with the assay when testing compounds and during experiment execution. For example, the following problems have been noted:

1. Problematic compounds:
 – Some substances have low solubility in the stock solutions or during dilution, which can lead to precipitation or phase separation when further diluted.  
 – Compounds that are inherently autofluorescent may interfere with the detection of the fluorescence endpoints (calcein-AM for viability and Hoechst H-33342 for nuclei) by adding background signal or obscuring the actual fluorescence (Section 6.5).

2. Hard-to-control experimental variables:
 – Autofluorescence from test compounds or solvent impurities can compromise the readout by interfering with the optimal exposure settings for the microscope.  
 – Variability in compound solubility across batches and during serial dilution poses difficulties in ensuring consistent compound availability in solution (Section 6.5).

3. Critical handling steps and potential pitfalls:
 – Careful pipetting is essential. Pipetting errors can occur if compound droplets are added too high above the medium surface, causing them to stick to the well walls rather than mixing properly.  
 – Adequate training on the use of multichannel/multistepper pipettes is required since errors such as wrong dispense speed or failure to mix properly can lead to variable compound concentrations.  
 – The coating of plates (with PLO/fibronectin) is critical—issues with water quality or differences between PLO/fibronectin lots can lead to cell clumping or uneven distribution. Plates should not be stored in the fridge and must be used immediately after overnight coating (Section 6.5).  
 – Coating quality and the consistency of cell seeding (e.g. proper cell density, appropriate confluency) are critical so that cells are in the right state (round and undifferentiated on treatment) when compounds are added.  
 – Imaging itself is a critical step; for example, focusing failures or imaging only one channel can produce outlier data. Operators must be well trained to ensure both channels (Hoechst and calcein) are imaged correctly (Section 6.5).

4. Robustness issues:
 – Operator training is crucial—operators require about 2–4 weeks of training before they can perform the assay smoothly, and even minor differences in technique (e.g. pipetting speed, timing of compound addition right after cell attachment) can alter outcomes.  
 – Variability may also derive from differences in consumables (e.g., plastic ware from different lots), differences in medium or supplement lots, or even environmental factors (such as seasonal temperature variations affecting cell handling and reagent performance).  
 – Edge effects in 96-well plates are managed by using only the inner 60 wells, as edge wells can experience evaporation or temperature gradients that contribute to variability (Section 6.5).

In summary, the assay is sensitive to issues with compound solubility and autofluorescence, and requires strict control over pipetting, wash/coating procedures, and timing. These factors, alongside operator expertise and differences in consumable quality, represent the main sources of variability and known pitfalls in the method.

Raw data are exported from the image analysis software (the Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS Reader) into an Excel file by copying the numerical results (for example, neurite area, cell counts, fluorescence intensities) – all technical replicate values are collected in one Excel file. The file is not in a proprietary or binary format but is a plain Excel‐sheet (.xlsx) that can be further processed. For instance, the raw Excel file may contain columns such as “Plate_ID”, “Well”, “Field”, “Channel_1_Intensity” (H-33342, used to identify nuclei), “Channel_2_Intensity” (calcein, used for neurite area and viability) and “Direct Image Analysis Output” (e.g. neurite area in pixel counts, cell count per well).

However, it lacks specific information on the processing steps, such as background correction, normalization, or how summary data like EC50 or BMC15 are derived. The answer is incomplete and lacks clarity on the full data processing workflow.","Raw image data are first processed by the Array Scan VTI HCS Reader software. In summary, the processing steps are as follows (Sources: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, sections 7.3 and 7.4):

1. Raw images in two channels (Hoechst for nuclei and calcein-AM for viable cell structures, including neurites) are acquired. The software applies flat field and background correction to each image. A dynamically determined intensity threshold (set at 12% of the maximal brightness) is used per field after these corrections.

2. The image analysis algorithms then identify nuclei (in the Hoechst channel) and define a “virtual cell soma area” (VCSA) by expanding the nuclear outlines. The calcein signal in the field is used to define the entire viable cellular structure (VCS). The neurite area is then calculated by subtracting the VCSA (cell body area) from the overall VCS, ensuring that only pixels beyond the cell soma are counted as neurites.

3. In parallel, an algorithm counts only the nuclei that co-localize with a calcein-positive signal (with defined intensity thresholds) to obtain viable cell numbers.

4. The quantified parameters (neurite area and cell counts) are then copied from the Array Scan software into an Excel spreadsheet. At this stage, measured values from medium controls and solvent (e.g. 0.1% DMSO) treated wells serve as the background and untreated control references.

5. Data normalization is performed by converting treated sample values into a percentage of the untreated control (which is set to 100%). This ensures that concentration‐response data are comparable across experiments.

6. Next, concentration–response curves are generated using GraphPad Prism. A nonlinear regression (typically a 4-parameter logistic fit) is applied to the normalized data to derive summary parameters such as EC50 or benchmark concentrations (BMC values). If non‐linear fitting is not feasible, a linear fit is used.

7. In addition, further analyses (e.g. calculation of BMC25 values and subsequent ratios such as BMC25 Viability/BMC25 Neurite Area for hazard evaluation) are performed. The calculated BMC values and their upper and lower confidence intervals (BMCU and BMCL) are determined using the online tool BMCeasy.

Thus, the complete processing workflow starts with background correction and flat field normalization during image analysis, followed by normalization of treated values relative to untreated (solvent control) values and, finally, curve fitting to extract potency and endpoint parameters (e.g. EC50, BMC values, ratios, and PoD).",0.7256798683685068,0.2502231299877167,-0.09509476274251938,0.05545995384454727
"How are data normally handled to obtain the overall test result (e.g. concentration response fitting using model X, determination of EC50 by method Y, use of EC50 as final data)? How do you model your concentration response curve (e.g. LL.4 parameter fit) and which software do you use (e.g. GraphPad Prism, R, etc.)? Do you usually calculate an uncertainty measure of your summary data (e.g. a 95% confidence interval for the BMC or a BMCL), and with which software? Can you give uncertainty for non-cytotoxicity or no-effect? How do you handle non-monotonic curve shapes or other curve features that are hard to describe with the usual mathematical fit model?","The data are analyzed with Excel and represented with GraphPad Prism. For the concentration curve, a nonlinear regression fit is calculated. The fitting method is least squares. If a non-linear curve fit is not possible, a linear curve fit is performed. The curve deriving from the fit is a 4-parameter log function. Treated concentrations are analyzed for deviation from control. Sometimes it is analyzed whether the deviation of neurite growth is different from the deviation of viability. This is done by two-way ANOVA + Tukey-Kramer post hoc testing. Statistics applied are one-way ANOVA (and nonparametric) with Dunnett’s post test. BMC values with their upper and lower confidence intervals (BMCU and BMCL) are calculated via the publically available online software: http://invitrotox.uni-konstanz.de/BMCeasy/",Medium,"The answer provides some details on data handling, such as using Excel and GraphPad Prism for analysis and a nonlinear regression fit for concentration curves. It mentions the use of a 4-parameter log function and statistical tests like ANOVA. However, it lacks clarity on how non-monotonic curves are handled and does not explicitly address uncertainty measures for non-cytotoxicity or no-effect. The mention of BMC values and confidence intervals is relevant but not fully detailed.","Data are first collected from the high‑content images (using the Cellomics Array Scan and its associated software), then the raw numbers (e.g. neurite area and cell counts) are copy‑pasted into Excel files where data from technical replicates are compiled (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, sections 7.1–7.3). These summary data are then analyzed in GraphPad Prism where we typically perform a nonlinear regression using a four‑parameter log (LL.4 parameter) model, fitting the concentration response via least‑squares. In cases where a nonlinear fit is not successful, a linear regression is performed instead (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, section 7.4).

To quantify uncertainty, we calculate benchmark concentration (e.g. BMC25) values along with their upper and lower confidence intervals (BMCL and BMCU). For this step, we use the publicly available online tool BMCeasy (http://invitrotox.uni-konstanz.de/BMCeasy/) and subsequently represent the data with GraphPad Prism or Excel. For compounds that do not induce cytotoxicity or any measurable effect (i.e. where the endpoint does not reach a defined BMC), the highest tested concentration is used to establish the effect threshold (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, sections 7.4 and 8.3).

When encountering non‐monotonic curve shapes or other responses that are hard to capture with the standard nonlinear model, the typical strategy is to first try the inherent fitting algorithm. If a nonlinear regression does not converge or does not adequately describe the data, we then apply a linear fit and inspect the data visually to ensure that technical outliers (e.g. due to partial image acquisition, focusing errors etc.) are recognized and, if justified, removed (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, section 7.4 and 6.9).",0.8349941474057899,0.3175677955150604,0.08436904847621918,0.19356028735637665

It also relates the test method to human adverse outcomes and potential hazards it predicts, providing a comprehensive and relevant response.","The assay is designed on the rationale that damage to human dopaminergic neurons—especially a reduction in neurite outgrowth combined with effects on cell viability—is an early key event that can be linked to adverse outcomes in the central nervous system. In this assay, LUHMES cells (a human dopaminergic neuronal model) are differentiated into post‐mitotic neurons and then exposed to test compounds. Their neurite outgrowth (which reflects processes such as neurite extension and neuronal interconnectivity) and viability (reflecting cell health and mitochondrial functionality) are quantified. Since these neurons rely strongly on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production, the test is particularly sensitive to mitochondrial toxicants that can compromise neurite formation and cell survival.

In other words:
• The toxicological target modeled is the human central nervous system—with a focus on dopaminergic neurons.
• The main biological process reflected is neurite outgrowth (a surrogate for neuronal network formation and differentiation) alongside cell viability.
• Toxicological events, including mitochondrial impairment leading to reduced neurite extension and cell death, are captured.
• These mechanistic changes are linked to adverse outcomes in vivo such as neurodegeneration (for instance, in dopaminergic pathways relevant to Parkinsonian deficits) and developmental neurotoxicity.
• Thus, the assay can potentially predict hazards associated with mitochondrial toxicants and compounds that disrupt cytoskeletal dynamics and neuronal connectivity.

In some scenarios the viability does not reach the BMC25 necessary for the ratio calculations. In this case the highest tested concentration (HTC) was used. Schematic representation of the complete prediction model is shown in scheme below.,Medium,"The answer provides some relevant information about the prediction models and criteria for determining hits, including specific thresholds for neurite area and viability. However, it lacks clarity and completeness in addressing all parts of the question, such as the rationale for the thresholds, the definition of borderline range, and the limitations of the prediction model. Additionally, the answer does not fully explain the toxicological rationale or provide a detailed explanation of the 'hit' definition in screening mode.","Below is a summary of the prediction model and the benchmark‐response statistics as outlined in the document:

(i) For dichotomized data, the assay uses two endpoints—neurite area and cell viability. In screening mode, a compound is considered “toxic” if it decreases the neurite area below a defined threshold while viability stays high. In the prediction model, a hit is defined by the following criteria:  
• Neurite area ≤80% of the solvent (DMSO) control  
• Viability ≥90% of the solvent control  
In other words, if neurite outgrowth is reduced by 20% or more without a major drop in viability (≥90%), the compound is classified as toxic (specific for neurite impairment) _(Sources: Sections 5.2, 8.2)_.

(ii) In the case of pseudo-dichotomized outcomes—where there is an intermediate or “borderline” class—the model uses benchmark concentration (BMC) values. Specifically, the ratio of BMC25 for viability (V) over BMC25 for neurite area (NA) is calculated. A ratio ≥4 is considered indicative of a specific neurotoxic effect. However, when the viability endpoint does not reach the BMC25 for calculation, the highest tested concentration (HTC) is used. Thus, compounds with a BMC25 V / BMC25 NA ratio close to 4 form the borderline class between clear non-toxicity and clear neurotoxicity _(Sources: Sections 8.2 and 8.3)_.

(iii) For multi‑class or continuous outcomes, the assay quantifies effects using full concentration–response curves. The responses (neurite area and viability) are fitted (usually by a four‑parameter log function using nonlinear regression) to obtain benchmark concentrations for a 25% change (BMC25). The rationale is twofold:  
 – Biologically, a 25% change is more frequently observed than a 50% change in these endpoints under the assay conditions, and it reflects a sensitive and reproducible response.  
 – Mathematically, the thresholds are set in a context of the intra-experimental variation (for example, the baseline variation has been measured at approximately 11.7 ± 4.5% for neurite outgrowth and 3.8 ± 3.5% for viability).  
Thus, the continuous outcome is interpreted via the ratio of the BMC25 for viability versus neurite area. A ratio ≥4 suggests a specific neurotoxic effect, beyond what would be expected from a general cytotoxic response _(Sources: Sections 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4)_.

Rationale and toxicological basis for the thresholds:  
• The thresholds are benchmarked against the response of narciclasine (used as a positive control), which reliably reduces neurite area (typically falling to around 40–75% of control) with little or no effect on viability.  
• Biologically, the cutoff of ≤80% for neurite area is chosen to capture even moderate impairments in neurite outgrowth, while a viability threshold of ≥90% ensures that the effect is not due to outright cytotoxicity.  
• Mathematically, the variation measures (e.g. ~12% intra-experimental variation for neurite area) support setting a benchmark response that is outside the expected variability.

Limitations of the prediction model include:  
• The model is based on a limited test concentration range and does not always allow a full 50% effect to be observed—hence the use of a 25% benchmark.  
• Handling variations (e.g. differences in cell passage, plastic coating, and pipetting precision) can affect the baseline response and may limit reproducibility.  
• The model is tuned to detect effects on neurite outgrowth in human dopaminergic neurons and might not capture toxic mechanisms that do not predominantly affect this endpoint.  
• In some cases the viability may not drop sufficiently to allow calculation of a BMC25, requiring the use of the highest tested concentration instead.

When the assay is used in screening mode, a “hit” is defined as a compound that meets the toxicity criteria for the dichotomized data—that is, it causes neurite area reduction to ≤80% of the control while keeping viability at ≥90%—which indicates a specific impairment of neurite outgrowth rather than generalized cytotoxicity _(Sources: Sections 5.2, 8.2, and 8.3)_.",0.8382877807586281,0.18353299796581268,-0.08832472562789917,0.03501499816775322

Due to the high similarity of the two assays, it is also used for the UKN4b assay. a) The prediction model was established using the following compounds (Stiegler 2011; Krug 2013): -colchicine -vincristine -nocodazole  Positive controls -etoposide -buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)  Unspecific toxicants affecting general viability -cycloheximide -paraquat  Rules of assay interpretation, criteria to define a positive test result -CCCP -2,4-DNP -SDS -tween-20 -K2CrO4 -H-33352 -tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (tBuOOH)  Unspecific toxicants b) The prediction model has been applied to screen 80 compound library of NTP (Delp et al., 2018).

Below, a set of compounds that triggers specific inhibition of neurite growth is shown (light blue). Other compounds are cytotoxic without specific effects on neurites (orange). The use of the updated prediction model BMC25 Viability (V) / BMC25 Neurite Area (NA) ≥ 4 was validated by comparing classifications derived by the initial and the updated prediction model. The reason for updating the prediction model was that a decrease of 50% in neurite area and viability cannot always be achieved with our range of test concentrations. An effect of 25% is more often observed and came to similar results when applied (Delp et al., 2018).",Medium,"The answer provides some relevant information about the prediction model setup, including the chemicals used and documentation references. However, it lacks clarity and completeness in addressing all aspects of the question, such as the specific classifiers/statistical approaches used, how the model applies to changes on both sides of controls, and how data in the opposite direction are handled. The explanation of the two-sided nature of the model and its interpretation is also insufficient.","Below is a summary of the prediction model setup and evaluation as described in the provided document:

1. Setup of the prediction model  
 • It was established by “training” the assay using a defined set of compounds. The training set included chemicals known to inhibit neurite outgrowth (used as positive controls) such as colchicine, vincristine, and nocodazole, and chemicals affecting cell viability unspecifically such as etoposide, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), cycloheximide, and paraquat. In addition, unspecific toxicants like CCCP, 2,4-DNP, SDS, tween‑20, K2CrO4, H‑33352, and tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (tBuOOH) were included.  
 • The model defines “hits” in a screening mode as a change (either decrease or increase) in neurite area while viability remains basically unchanged (the criteria given are neurite area ≤80% of the DMSO control and viability ≥90% of the DMSO control). In a second, hazard evaluation mode the model uses benchmark concentration values (BMC25) for viability (V) and neurite area (NA) and considers a compound “specifically neurotoxic” if the ratio BMC25 V / BMC25 NA is ≥4. For borderline cases, if viability does not reach the BMC25 threshold, the highest tested concentration is used instead.  
  _(Source: Sections 8.2 and 8.3)_

2. Testing of the prediction model  
 • The model was applied on well‐defined chemical sets. In one study, an 80‑compound library (the “NTP80 screen”) was used (Delp et al., 2018). In another application, the model was applied to a 120‑compound library (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020). In addition, to date, 53 unique compounds (as defined by unique DTXSIDs) have been tested in the assay. Since n is greater than 50 in some tests, the answer for “listing chemicals” is provided as the number tested.  
  _(Source: Sections 8.2–8.3)_

3. Documentation of the process  
 • The development and application of the prediction model are documented in several publications, in particular in Krug et al. (2013) and Stiegler et al. (2011), with further documentation and validation in Delp et al. (2018) and Masjosthusmann et al. (2020).  
  _(Source: Sections 8.2–8.3)_

4. Directionality of effects and treatment of data  
 • The screening prediction model is described to flag any significant change in neurite area—i.e. a decrease (reduction in neurite outgrowth) or an increase—while viability remains essentially unchanged. This indicates that the model is in principle two-sided regarding the neurite readout.  
 • However, the published thresholds (for example, the use of a positive control narciclasine that reduces neurite area to ≤80% of control while viability remains ≥90%) suggest that the model was primarily designed to detect neurite inhibition (a decrease).  
 • The document does not describe a separate set of rules or thresholds for increases. In other words, while the general wording (“decrease/increase”) implies that both directions can be flagged, the detailed criteria and performance data provided (e.g. the benchmark concentration ratio BMC25 V/NA ≥4) have been applied principally to situations where toxicants reduce neurite area relative to controls. Data showing an effect in the opposite direction (for example, increased neurite area) are not separately characterized with different rules; they would be interpreted within the same framework and only flagged as hits if the predefined criteria are met.  
  _(Source: Sections 8.2 and 8.3)_

In summary, the model was set up using a training set of known neurotoxic compounds for inhibition (and unspecific toxicants) and subsequently applied on panels of 80 and 120 chemicals (with >50 unique compounds tested overall). The process is documented in the referenced publications. Although the hit definition is phrased as “decrease/increase,” the detailed criteria (using positive controls and BMC25-based ratios) are primarily geared toward detecting decreases in neurite outgrowth—with no distinct secondary rules described for increases.",0.7771200851789817,0.1104249507188797,-0.023848094046115875,0.04312388226389885

Due to the high similarity of the two assays, a comparable test performance is expected for the UKN3b assay. Some background on the test performance is given in chapters 8.2/8.3 (prediction model). Several performance parameters for the test were obtained in several separate evaluation rounds. A first evaluation was done during the first publication of the model and its applications (Stiegler et al. 2011, Krueg et al. 2013). Here, a panel of well-selected positive and negative controls have been tested. Accordingly, the specificity was 100% and the sensitivity was > 90 %. In dedicated experiments, S/N ratios of > 20 and a z’ of > 0.5 have been determined. The compound narciclasine (run on each plate as positive control) was tested across 36 different test plates and 12 independent assay runs. The neurite area relative to the solvent control varied between 40% and 75% across all plates with a viability value constantly >90% (Delp et al. 2018). The test has been used in screening campaigns, and real-live performance data under broader screen conditions have been obtained. The different performance data need to be considered, when a compound is a hit in a screen, or whether it has been specifically evaluated in a hit follow-up or a mechanistic project. A first screen application has been the NTP80 screen (80 compounds provided by the US NTP). Data are published Delp et al. 2018. A second screen application has been the cross systems case study of the EU-ToxRisk project. The baseline variation is indicated in Krebs et al., 2020. Moreover, an overview is given for 19 compounds on the BMC/BMCL ratio as measure of readout certainty. A third screen was performed in the context of the EFSA DNT test battery evaluation with 120 compounds (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). From this screen the following performance indicators were obtained: A: Sensitivity: 100%  With NeuriTox as standalone assay in 17 `tool negatives´ tested (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). B: Specificity: 82.7%  With NeuriTox combined in a full DNT battery and a selected set of 27 positive compounds with evidence for DNT (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). C: Baseline variation (intra-experimental) Neurite outgrowth: 11.7 ± 4.5% Cell viability: 3.8 ± 3.5% D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) Neurite outgrowth: 15.3% Cell viability: 4.3% E: Variation of a positive control run on each (inter-experimental) Neurite outgrowth: 38.5% Definition of values C-E C: Baseline variation (intra-experimental) is the mean CV±SD of the CV of all replicates of the solvent control from each experiment across n>200 experiments. D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) is the variability across all independent experiments (n>200) after normalization based on the response of the lowest test concentration. It was assumed that the lowest test concentration does not affect any of the endpoints measured. E: Variation of a positive control run on each (inter-experimental) is the variability of the positive control across all independent experiments (n>40) after normalization. Example for a positive control that on average reduced the specific endpoint down to 40% (relative to solvent control) and a calculated variability of 50%: 0.5 x 40% = +/- 20%  The positive control with mean of 40% varies from 20% to 60%.",High,"The answer provides a comprehensive evaluation of the test method's performance parameters, including specificity, sensitivity, signal/noise ratio, z-factor, baseline variation, and inter-operator variations. It also references multiple studies and data sources, offering detailed information on how these parameters were determined.

• Baseline variation (noise):  
 – Intra‐experimental variability of neurite outgrowth is reported as 11.7 ± 4.5% and for cell viability 3.8 ± 3.5%.  
 – Inter‐experimental variability is 15.3% for neurite outgrowth and 4.3% for cell viability.

• Signal-to-noise ratio and z′‑factor:  
 – Dedicated experiments determined signal/noise ratios of >20 when using narciclasine as the standard positive control.  
 – The z′‐factor was found to be >0.5.  
  _(Source: Section 8.4 “Test performance”)_

• Specificity of the test method:  
 – In early evaluations the specificity was determined as 100% by testing a panel of well‐selected positive and negative controls. In a later screen within the full DNT battery, specificity was reported at 82.7% (with the assay used standalone showing close to 100%).  
 – Specificity is determined by comparing the response of known positive controls (e.g. narciclasine) with that of unspecific toxicants as well as by the hit‐confirmation using the prediction model.  
  _(Source: Section 8.4 “Test performance” and 8.3 “Prediction model”)_

• Sensitivity of the test method:  
 – Sensitivity was initially reported as >90% and in standalone screening (e.g. NeuriTox as a singular assay) sensitivity reached 100%.  
 – It is determined by testing a range of compounds (including well‐established neurotoxicants) and assessing the ability of the assay to detect specific decreases in neurite area before a decline in viability occurs.  
  _(Source: Section 8.4 “Test performance” and 8.3 “Prediction model”)_

• Measures of uncertainty:  
 – Uncertainty is quantified through the reported intra- and inter-experimental variability (CVs) both for neurite outgrowth and viability, as well as from the variation observed for the positive control across many plates (e.g. neurite area reductions varied from 40% to 75% of solvent control when using narciclasine across 36 plates and 12 assay runs).  
  _(Source: Sections 8.4 “Test performance”)_

• Detection limit and quantification:  
 – The assay is sensitive to a decrease of about 25% in neurite area (this 25% effect is mentioned as often observed in the prediction model work using BMC25 criteria).  
 – No explicit values were given for a limit of detection (LOD) or limit of quantification (LOQ).  
  _(Source: Section 8.3 “Prediction model”)_

• Inter-operator variation and historical controls:  
 – Although no explicit numerical inter-operator variation is provided, the protocol emphasizes that operators must be trained (approximately 4 weeks) to perform the assay with low variability.  
 – Historical control data are maintained – for example, the positive control narciclasine has been run across multiple plates (36 plates, 12 independent assay runs) with neurite area values relative to solvent controls consistently falling between 40% and 75% and viability values always >90%.

1. Parameters for determining free compound concentrations (the “free” concentration) require information on how much of the compound binds to lipids and binding proteins. In the UKN4b (MitoMet) assay, the only reported quantitative information relates to the medium. In section 8.5, the medium’s lipid content is given as 2.9 mg/l and its albumin concentration (a proxy for binding protein content) is 5.8 µM, whereas human plasma values are 6000 mg/l and 600 µM, respectively.

However, it lacks detail on how the test reacts to mixtures and UVCBs, does not specify areas to be excluded or particularly suitable for testing, and does not mention any compounds known to interfere with the test system.","Based on the description of the UKN4b assay:

1. Compounds likely to be picked up correctly include those that affect mitochondrial function and cytoskeletal dynamics. In particular, the assay detects compounds that reduce neurite outgrowth without simultaneously reducing cell viability (for example, mitochondrial toxicants and cytoskeletal poisons such as narciclasine, colchicine, vincristine, and nocodazole as used in the prediction model). In contrast, compounds that act through pathways not represented in these human dopaminergic neurons are less likely to be detected. (Sources: Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.6)

2. The assay is designed to reveal specific neurotoxicity (measured mainly through changes in neurite area) while largely maintaining viability. Thus, it may fail with compounds that—for example—reduce both neurite outgrowth and viability in a non‐selective manner. It also does not cover all aspects of in vivo neurotoxicity (such as specific endocrine‐mediated effects or actions by neurotransmitters for which the receptors are not expressed). (Sources: Sections 1.2, 8.1, 8.6)

3. There is no specific information in the provided document regarding the testing of mixtures or UVCBs. (Source: No explicit mention in the documents)

4. No detailed guidelines are provided regarding specific industry sectors or compound chemistries (e.g. based on physical–chemical properties) to exclude or target. However, by design the test system is a CNS dopaminergic neuronal model and is particularly suited for compounds that impair mitochondrial function or neurite outgrowth in such cells. Compounds acting via mechanisms that are not represented in these neurons (for example, those requiring specific endocrine or neurotransmitter receptor pathways not present or not active in this test system) are less likely to be detected. (Sources: Sections 8.1, 8.6, 8.7)

5. As an example, endocrine disruptors that act via pathways not present in LUHMES cells and neurotransmitters (or their analogs) for which the required receptors are absent cannot be detected. Moreover, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and HDAC inhibitors have been reported to have no effect in this assay. (Source: Section 8.6)

6. Finally, certain compounds—particularly those with strong autofluorescence or inherent color—can interfere with the assay readouts. In practice, substances that are fluorescent or colored may affect the detection of the calcein‐AM and Hoechst H‑33342 signals, potentially leading to erroneous results. (Source: Section 6.5)

(Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, section 8.7)

Specifically:
• It complements other assays such as UKN5 (which uses peripheral neurons) by focusing on central neurons with a dopaminergic phenotype. This specificity is highlighted by its sensitivity to mitochondrial toxicants (e.g. MPP+), which is more pronounced in this assay compared to others. (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, section 8.7)
• As a test battery component, strengths include medium- to high-throughput capacity, automated microscopy for objective endpoint measurements (neurite area and cell viability), and a prediction model that can help flag compounds with specific neurodevelopmental toxicity. (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, sections 8.1 and 8.7)
• Its weaknesses involve that it does not cover all aspects of in vivo neurotoxicity, as it is primarily focused on neurite outgrowth and mitochondrial dysfunction. The assay depends on specialized handling (e.g. LUHMES cell culture, multichannel pipetting, and a high-content imaging system) and subjective visual acceptance criteria at some stages. (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, sections 4.2, 4.3, and 8.6)

In the context of a test battery, the assay fills an important gap:
– It specifically detects compound-induced impairment in neurite outgrowth in dopaminergic neurons, complementing other assays that might focus on other cell types or endpoints.
– It is particularly useful as a screening tool for alerts (first-tier use) and can also serve as a confirmation assay in follow-up studies focused on mechanistic aspects (especially regarding mitochondrial toxicants). (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, sections 8.1, 8.3, and 8.7)

Thus, for practical use:
• In a first-tier battery, this assay can be used to generate alerts given its high sensitivity and throughput.
• It is also useful as a stand-alone assay for screening mitochondrial toxicants, though its scope is limited to specific endpoints.
• For full hazard evaluation of neurotoxicants, complementary assays (covering additional aspects of neurodevelopmental toxicity) are recommended, allowing cross-confirmation and mechanistic insights. (Sources: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, sections 8.3 and 9.5)

Overall, the MitoMet assay is both a screening and a confirmation tool within a DNT testing battery, with strengths in throughput and mechanistic relevance, but it should ideally be used in combination with other assays to cover the complete in vivo-like neurotoxicity landscape.",0.7570383386399967,0.13566628098487854,-0.08232373744249344,0.01983340084552765

PMID: 34114044",Low,"The answer provides a list of publications but does not detail deviations from published descriptions, nor does it describe the aspects covered by the publications or provide comments on the types of information obtained from them. It lacks clarity and completeness in addressing the question.","Below is an answer based strictly on the provided document (MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf):

1. Published descriptions of the test system and method are available in several key publications. For example, Scholz et al. (2011) and Stiegler et al. (2011) give comprehensive overviews of LUHMES cell differentiation into dopaminergic neurons and the use of automated microscopy to quantify neurite outgrowth. Lotharius et al. (2005) provides background on the cell origin and dopaminergic features of the LUHMES system. In addition, Krug et al. (2013) describes the detailed procedure and rationale for using neurite outgrowth as a sensitive endpoint for neurotoxicity testing. All these publications cover aspects such as cell generation and differentiation, neurite network formation, and the use of automated high-content imaging for endpoint quantification _(Sources: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_.

2. Deviations from these published protocols that are noted in the current test method include:  
  a. Plastic plate/coating details: Our protocol specifies coating 96‐well plates with a solution of poly‑L‑ornithine (43 µg/ml) and fibronectin (1 µg/ml) prepared in purified MilliQ water. It is noted that variations in plastic ware (including different suppliers or new lots) can influence cell attachment and distribution—a potential deviation if previously published protocols used different suppliers or coating protocols.  
  b. Cell number: In our method, 30,000 cells/well in 90 µl (with 10 µl of compound dilution added later) are used. Although published protocols (e.g. in the UKN4 assay) document cell seeding densities, our specific number and timing (re-plating at day 2 after reaching 20–30 Mio cells per T75 flask) are defined to optimize attachment and early neurite outgrowth, which may vary from earlier descriptions.  
  c. Endpoint measurement: Our method uses dual staining with calcein‑AM for viable cells and Hoechst H‑33342 for nuclear identification, with an automated imaging algorithm that first defines a “virtual cell soma area” (by expanding the nuclear outline by 3.2 µm) and then subtracts the soma from the total viable cellular structures to derive the neurite area. This approach with predetermined intensity thresholds and binning parameters is a refined and automated version compared to earlier, possibly more manual or differently parameterized descriptions.  
  d. Timing of events: Our protocol involves seeding at day −1, medium change on day 0, re-plating on day 2 using medium with galactose (instead of glucose) for increased sensitivity to mitochondrial toxicants, and a final imaging readout at 23.5 h after compound exposure on day 3. This specific exposure schedule (including the use of galactose medium from day 2 onward) represents a methodological deviation to enhance sensitivity compared with the standard UKN4 assay which is run under glucose conditions _(Sources: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_.

In summary, the most critical publications (Scholz et al., Stiegler et al., and Krug et al.) comprehensively describe both the cell system and methodological aspects, while further publications (Delp et al., Masjosthusmann et al.) expand upon assay performance, chemical test lists, and integration in a battery of tests. These references collectively support the interpretation of our assay’s protocols and innovations, noting the specific deviations (e.g. plate coating, cell number, media composition, and timing adjustments) used to optimize sensitivity and reproducibility for detecting mitochondrial and neurite-specific toxic effects _(Sources: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf)_",0.7110904326604582,0.44289103150367737,0.31110110878944397,0.3765263557434082

However, it lacks clarity on whether the test method specifically covers an AOP MIE/KE and does not reference the status of these AOPs in the AOP-wiki. The response is partially complete but lacks specific details and clarity required for a 'High' score.","The assay has indeed been linked to several AOPs as it measures a downstream key event—namely, impaired neurite outgrowth—which is highly relevant in neurotoxicity pathways. For example, the Annex lists potential links to:

• AOP 48 (Binding of agonists to ionotropic glutamate receptors leading to excitotoxicity and subsequent neuronal cell death), which covers a key event related to network impairment.  
• AOP 3 (Inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I of nigra‑striatal neurons leading to parkinsonian motor deficits), where mitochondrial impairment is the molecular initiating event (MIE) and reduced neurite outgrowth is part of the cascade leading to neurodegeneration.  

In these cases, while the assay does not directly measure the molecular initiating event (MIE), its readout (neurite area reduction) serves as an indicator of key event activation in these AOPs. In other words, the test method covers key events within the framework of multiple AOPs. These AOPs are available on AOP‑Wiki (e.g., see AOP 48 and AOP 3), although full regulatory status and detailed peer‑review may vary.

"Indicate/summarize information on mechanistic validation, e.g. by omics approaches or by use of endpoint specific controls (MCC; section 5.5).

Are of human origin, form network b) Tubulin plays a major role in neurite outgrowth and if inhibited by colchicine/vincristine/nocodazole neurite outgrowth is reduced. If the Rho/Rock pathway is activated, neurite outgrowth is enhanced. c) A formal mechanistic validation has not been performed. Reversibility and protection/counterregulation by mechanistic compounds have been shown (Stiegler 2011; Krug AK) for the similar UKN4 assay.",Medium,"The answer provides some relevant information about the mechanistic validation, mentioning the dopaminergic nature of LUHMES cells and their human origin, which partially addresses the question. It also discusses the role of tubulin and the Rho/Rock pathway in neurite outgrowth. However, it lacks a comprehensive exploration of how the system reflects human biology and tissue organization relevant to the specific form of toxicity. The mention of a lack of formal mechanistic validation and references to other studies suggest incompleteness in addressing the question fully.","The assay incorporates mechanistic validation in two complementary ways. First, endpoint‐specific control compounds (MCCs) have been integrated into the protocol. For example, narciclasine is used as a positive control to elicit neurite growth inhibition (Section 5.5), while additional modulators (such as HA‑1077 and blebbistatine acting via the Rho/ROCK pathway) are used to enhance or confirm changes in neurite outgrowth. These controls help establish that the observed effects on neurite area are due to specific molecular mechanisms rather than nonspecific cytotoxicity.

Second, the assay’s relevance to human biology has been explored using omics approaches. Comprehensive transcriptome analyses (including microarray studies) have characterized LUHMES cell differentiation. These analyses have confirmed that the cells express key dopaminergic markers such as tyrosine hydroxylase and the dopamine transporter, as well as additional synaptic proteins and genes related to neurodegeneration (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease‐related markers). This omics data supports that the differentiated LUHMES cells mimic aspects of human nigrostriatal neurons—not only in terms of their signaling and biochemical phenotype, but also in the formation of neuronal networks with neurite outgrowth that reflects in vivo tissue organization.

Overall, while a formal mechanistic validation has not been fully completed, the integration of MCCs together with the extensive omics characterization demonstrates that the system reflects the essential features of human dopaminergic neurons required for assessing toxicants that affect neuronal development and mitochondrial function.

What are procedures and how was the performance (experience) of the transfer?,Test system (UKN LUHMES cells) has been transferred and established to numerous other labs.,Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by confirming that the test system has been transferred to other labs. However, it lacks details on whether the test method has been used by various operators over a long time period, data on inter-laboratory variability, and information on procedures and performance of the transfer.","The test system has been successfully transferred to other laboratories. The document states that the UKN LUHMES cell system “has been transferred and established to numerous other labs” (Section 10.2, MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf). In terms of operator use, the protocol emphasizes that operators must be trained in LUHMES cell culture, multichannel pipetting, and the use of specialized imaging equipment—a process that typically requires about 4 weeks for smooth assay performance (Section 10.1, MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf).

However, while the method has been implemented in various labs, no formal data on inter-laboratory variability or a systematic ring trial evaluation was reported in the provided document (Section 9.4 and Section 10.2, MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf).

Procedural details include documented operator training, adherence to a standardized protocol (SOP no. 200 available in the DB-ALM database), and detailed day-to-day documentation of experiment execution, which helps in maintaining consistency across different operators and sites.

"Are there special legal requirements for running the test in your lab; are there special hazards associated with the test that may affect operators, bystanders, others (e.g. through waste).",No specific requirements.,Low,"The answer is too brief and lacks detail. It does not address potential special hazards associated with the test or provide any information about legal requirements, which are crucial aspects of the question.","According to the test description, there are no special legal requirements or additional hazards beyond those normally encountered in S1 cell culture laboratories.

Are the SDSs for all hazardous reagents used in the test method available? Are the SDSs for all hazardous test compounds stored? Describe where and how the SDSs are stored internally. How is safe handling ensured? Is the exposure scenario for the hazardous reagents used in the test method available?,SDS are available in the university DaMaRIS database (Dangerous Materials Registry Information System).,Low,"The answer only partially addresses the availability of SDSs by mentioning their presence in a database. It does not describe where and how the SDSs are stored internally, how safe handling is ensured, or if the exposure scenario for the hazardous reagents is available.","Based on the available documentation:

1. SDS Availability and Storage:
 • All SDSs for hazardous reagents used in the assay are available and are stored internally in the university’s DaMaRIS database (Dangerous Materials Registry Information System) (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, Section 11.2). The documentation indicates that the SDSs for all hazardous test compounds are maintained in this database.

2. Safe Handling:
 • Safe handling is ensured by following laboratory practices in an S1 cell culture facility. Operators are trained in the proper handling procedures (including multichannel pipetting, compound dilution, and cell culture techniques) and work under standardized safety guidelines. Additionally, compounds are aliquoted into single-use volumes to avoid repeated thawing and potential degradation, which helps maintain safety and compound integrity (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, Sections 6.1 and 11.1–11.2).

3. Exposure Scenario:
 • The documentation does not provide a specific, detailed exposure scenario for the hazardous reagents beyond the standard laboratory handling and storage procedures outlined. In other words, while safe handling measures and storage practices are well described, an explicit exposure scenario for these reagents is not available in the documents (Source: MitoMetassay(UKN4b).pdf, Section 11).

"Are special permits (e.g. genetic work, stem cells, radioactivity, etc.) required? Are special facilities required? Is special ethical approval necessary (indicate approval document).",Work requires S1 cell culture laboratories (genetically modified cells). No specific facilities are required. No specific ethical approval is required.,High,"The answer fully addresses the question by specifying the requirement for S1 cell culture laboratories for genetically modified cells, indicating that no specific facilities or ethical approvals are required. It is relevant and complete.","According to section 11 of the provided document, no additional permits are required for working with genetically modified cells (beyond the requirement that the work be performed in S1 cell culture laboratories), and no special facilities are needed beyond those. Likewise, no specific ethical approval is necessary, and no approval document has been indicated.
