Please describe in no more than 200 words the following:,,,,"The NeuriTox assay (UKN4) is an in vitro method designed to detect compound-induced impairments in neurite outgrowth in human dopaminergic neurons derived from LUHMES cells. In this assay, proliferating LUHMES cells are seeded and differentiated using tetracycline, cAMP, and GDNF to form post-mitotic neurons with developing neurites. On day two of differentiation, the cells are replated in 96‑well plates and exposed to test compounds for 24 hours. Following toxicant treatment, the cells are live-stained with calcein-AM and Hoechst H‑33342, and the neurite area is quantified by automated high-content imaging, while viability is assessed in parallel. The assay is optimized to identify both developmental neurotoxicity and selective neurite inhibition, with positive control compounds such as narciclasine ensuring assay performance. Its high-throughput format permits screening of compound libraries, making it valuable for hazard evaluation related to neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.

"Which biological process(es) (e.g. neurite outgrowth, differentiation) and/or toxicological events (e.g. oxidative stress, cell death) are modelled/reflected by your test method? (8.1)",,Low,No answer provided; treated as missing.,"The NeuriTox assay is designed to model the process of neurite outgrowth and concurrently assess cell viability. By doing so, it reflects key toxicological events such as developmental neurotoxicity. Specifically, the assay mimics the early differentiation of LUHMES cells into dopaminergic neurons and monitors how compounds may impair neurite outgrowth—a critical aspect of neuronal network formation—while also evaluating general cellular health (viability). This dual readout helps predict potential hazards for the developing nervous system.

It does not specify quantitative definitions for acceptance criteria, does not address functional parameters or pluripotency control for iPSCs, and does not discuss stability and identity of supply for primary cells. Additionally, it does not mention exclusion criteria or special requirements for genetically-modified cells and microphysiological systems.","The initial LUHMES cells (i.e. proliferating cells before differentiation) are accepted only if they meet clearly defined quality‐ and identity criteria. For example, the cells must be pathogen‐free; routine testing for mycoplasma is performed (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, section 3.4). In addition, cells from the working stock are checked for correct marker gene expression upon stock creation. Every thawed batch is then visually inspected: cells should show an oval morphology without extensive aggregation or clustering, and about 5–10% cell death is acceptable. An increased cell death rate in a passage just after thawing is a criterion to discard the batch. Also, the culture medium must not show signs of over‐acidification (i.e. it should not be yellow) (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, section 3.4).

For routine use of proliferating LUHMES cells, only cells up to passage 18 are deemed valid. Although questions regarding pluripotency monitoring (as for iPSCs) or extended primary cell functions (such as xenobiotic metabolism) are not applicable here, the test system does require the cells to reliably differentiate into dopaminergic neurons with defined neurite outgrowth characteristics.

However, it lacks detail on critical consumables, batch effects, handling steps, and specific recommendations for genetically-modified cells and microphysiological systems. The response could be more comprehensive and detailed to fully address the question.","The documents identify several factors that contribute to variability between source cells. For example, the quality and consistency of the plastic coating (poly‐L-ornithine and fibronectin) are critical because differences in coating (including water quality and storage conditions) can lead to uneven cell distribution, clumping, or aggregation (NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, sections 3.5 and 6.5). Variations may also arise due to differences in cell batches and passage numbers; cells from a new thaw or later passages can behave differently and influence differentiation and viability (NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, section 3.5). In addition, plastic ware itself can vary between suppliers or lots – a known source of variability. Although the assay does not describe serum effects (it is based on LUHMES cells maintained in defined media), similar principles would apply where consumables such as coating reagents, trypsin, or any additives are used: changes in batches or types (e.g. type of trypsin or transferrin isoforms) could impact cell detachment, viability, or differentiation patterns.

Regarding critical handling steps, the following are noted:
• Rapid and accurate pipetting is essential—errors during seeding, medium change, and compound addition (using a multichannel pipette) can cause variability. For instance, cell seeding must be performed quickly and uniformly to avoid extended room‐temperature exposure (NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, section 6.5).
• The cell density must be carefully controlled during seeding (not too low or too high, with a confluency target between 40–90%) ensuring an even attach and growth; overconfluency or insufficient numbers can alter metabolic and differentiation behavior (NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, sections 3.5 and 4.2).
• Washing and coating procedures are also sensitive; for example, any error in the coating wash (e.g. number of rinses or using the wrong washing solution) may compromise the substrate for cell attachment (NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, section 3.5).

When working with genetically modified cells or microphysiological systems, additional care must be taken regarding matrix chemistry, geometry, and even microfluidics, although these aspects are not detailed for this assay specifically. However, similar principles imply that surface properties (e.g. coated vs non‐coated regions, edge effects) and consistent material lots (e.g. plastic ware and reagents) will be critical for reproducibility.

Recommendations to improve reproducibility and performance include: 
– Standardizing consumables by using the same supplier and verifying batches (e.g. for coating reagents and plastic ware) to reduce lot-to-lot variability.
– Keeping handling procedures consistent: use calibrated multichannel pipettes; train operators to perform rapid and uniform seeding and media changes; and document any deviations immediately.
– Monitoring cell density and passage number strictly, and using cells only within recommended passages.
– For cells that are genetically modified, ensure that any matrix dependencies or microfluidic supports are maintained identical between experiments.

Implementing these recommendations should increase the consistency of source cell quality and overall assay performance (NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, sections 3.5 and 6.5).",0.7395179412487701,0.1775413602590561,-0.16732071340084076,-0.01836768165230751

Coating of flasks and plates principle: plates and flasks are coated with a poly-L-orthinine (PLO) and fibronectin solution in ion-exchanged and purified MilliQ-H2O overnight in the cell culture incubator. The next day the coated plastic ware is washed with MilliQ water once and dried under sterile conditions in the cell culture hood. The coated plastic can be stored at 4°C up to 4 weeks. Differentiation principle: For differentiation, the following growth factors are added: GDNF (glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor), dibutyryl-cAMP (Cyclic adenosine monophosphate) and tetracycline. If differentiation medium without cAMP and GDNF is required, the volume of those components is replaced with DMEM/F12 Advanced.  Annex A Figure 2: LUHMES cells were maintained in their proliferating precursor state in proliferation medium containing N2 and FGF. 24 h before differentiation (-24 h) they were seeded into a pre-coated T75 flask at a density of 40,000/cm2. On d0 (0 h), the medium was changed to differentiation medium containing tetracycline, cAMP and GDNF. After 2 days of differentiation (48 h), the cells were re-plated into coated 96-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells/cm² in DM without cAMP and GDNF containing glucose as carbohydrate source. 1 h after attachment (49 h), the cells were treated for 24 h. Then, they were stained with 1 μg/ml H-33342 and 1 μM calcein-AM and imaged using a Cellomics CellInsight. Neurite area and viability were determined.",Medium,"The answer provides a detailed description of the differentiation protocol, including phases, media, and manipulation steps. However, it lacks a graphical overview and does not fully address special/additional requirements for microphysiological systems and organoids, such as cell printing or interaction with the matrix. The explanation is somewhat fragmented and could be more cohesive.","The protocol is based on a two‐step differentiation process of LUHMES cells onto pre‐coated surfaces. Initially, proliferating LUHMES cells are maintained in a proliferation medium (containing N2, basic fibroblast growth factor, etc.) and, about 24 hours before differentiation (day –1), they are seeded into pre‐coated T75 flasks. The plasticware is coated with a poly‑L‑ornithine and fibronectin solution to ensure even cell distribution. On day 0 the proliferation medium is replaced with a differentiation medium supplemented with tetracycline (which shuts off v‑myc expression), dibutyryl‑cAMP, and GDNF. This combination triggers the cells to exit the proliferative state and start extending neurites.

After approximately 2 days (48 hours of differentiation), the cells – which now show neurites roughly as long as their cell bodies – are trypsinized and re-plated onto coated 96‑well plates at a defined density. At this stage (day 2), the medium used for re-plating is the differentiation medium modified by the omission of cAMP and GDNF and the replacement of the carbohydrate source with glucose. About 30 minutes after re-plating, when cells have attached but still appear round, toxicants can be added (via a short pipetting step). Finally, on day 3, roughly 23.5 hours after toxicant treatment the cells are live stained (using Hoechst H‑33342 for nuclei and calcein‑AM for viable cells) and imaged with high-content microscopy for neurite area and viability quantification.

A simplified scheme of the differentiation protocol is as follows:  
 • Day –1: Seed proliferating LUHMES cells into pre-coated flasks (using proliferation medium).  
 • Day 0: Change medium to differentiation medium supplemented with tetracycline, cAMP, and GDNF to initiate differentiation.  
 • Day 2: After 48 h, trypsinize and re-plate cells onto 96-well plates pre-coated with the same substrate. Use modified differentiation medium (without cAMP and GDNF but with glucose).  
 • Approximately 1 h after re-plating (day 2), add the test compounds; then, after 24 h of treatment, perform live staining and image acquisition (day 3).

This protocol is designed for 2D monolayer cultures, and no special additional manipulation steps (such as cell printing, self-aggregation, or geometrical characterization required for microphysiological systems or organoids) are mentioned in the document. Accordingly, the focus is on a controlled medium change, precise re-plating densities, and timing of additive applications to consistently induce neurite growth and measure compound effects.

• Cells outside the experiment are maintained as follows. LUHMES cells are propagated in proliferation medium containing bFGF. They are split every 2–3 days (typically Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) ensuring that the cell confluency stays between about 40% and 85%. Splitting is done at defined cell numbers (for example, seeding 3 Mio cells per T75 flask for 2‑day cultures). This routine propagation guarantees robust growth and prepares the cells for subsequent differentiation.

• With respect to cell purity, the assay is performed with the UKN LUHMES cell line – a well‐characterized subclone of the human mesencephalic-derived cell line MESC2.10. Although a specific numerical purity (e.g. “95% Oct4‐positive”) is not provided for these cells (and they are not iPSC but conditionally immortalized and differentiated dopaminergic cells), marker gene expression is checked when a working stock is generated and cells are routinely inspected for proper morphology and absence of clustering or excessive cell death.  
(Source: Sections 3.2 “Overview of cell source component(s)” and 3.4 “Acceptance criteria for source cell population”)

• Quality control measures and acceptance criteria include:  
  – Testing for pathogen‐freedom (e.g. regular mycoplasma testing after thawing).  
  – Visual inspection of cell morphology (cells should appear oval, not form extensive aggregates, and have less than approximately 5–10% cell death under normal conditions).  
  – For working stock cells, additional marker gene expression is checked when the stock is created.  
  – If, upon thawing, cells show increased cell death or abnormal morphology, the batch is discarded.  
(Source: Section 3.4 “Acceptance criteria for source cell population”)

• Regarding passage numbers, the LUHMES cells used for the test should be derived from a working stock that is not used beyond passage 18. Although the cells are cultured up to passage 20–25 in some cases, only the early passages (up to 18) of the working stock are recommended for the assay.  
(Source: Section 3.4 “Acceptance criteria for source cell population” and Section 3.1)

• While the documentation does not explicitly state “GCCP” or “GIVIMP”, the assay is conducted under rigorous standard cell culture conditions with detailed SOPs, proper documentation of culture conditions, cell counts, and troubleshooting, which align with good cell culture practice.  
(Source: General practices outlined in NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, especially Sections 3.1–3.7 and 6 “Handling details of the test method”)

• The same working cell batch is used only until the acceptable passage limit (i.e. up to passage 18). New cell batches are routinely generated by thawing a vial from the working stock every 4 weeks.  
(Source: Section 3.1 “Supply of source cells” and Section 3.4)

• Preparation of frozen stocks and cell banks is carried out as follows: The original LUHMES masterstock (obtained in 2006) is thawed approximately every 4–5 years and extensively expanded. These expanded cells are frozen as a working stock. For daily experiments, a new cell batch is thawed every 4 weeks from this working stock to ensure optimal performance.

After 24 h of treatment (including staining), the cells are imaged using a high-content microscope (Cellomics).",Medium,"The answer provides a detailed timeline of the test system's preparation and treatment process, including cell seeding, medium changes, and staining procedures. However, it lacks information on the general features/principles of the culture protocol, such as collagen embedding or 3D structuring. It also does not address the percentage of contaminating cells, subpopulation percentages in co-cultures, or differential cytotoxicity among subpopulations, which are key aspects of the question.","The test system is based on human LUHMES cells that are first maintained as proliferating precursors and then differentiated into dopaminergic neurons before use in the assay. In preparation (see sections 3.6 and 4), proliferating LUHMES cells are seeded (day –1) in proliferation medium. At day 0, the medium is exchanged for differentiation medium and the cells are exposed to a defined cocktail of factors—tetracycline (to shut off the v-myc oncogene), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and dibutyryl-cAMP—to initiate differentiation. After 2 days of differentiation, when the cells have expanded sufficiently, they are trypsinized and re-plated onto pre-coated 96‐well plates. The coating, using poly‑L‑ornithine (PLO) and fibronectin, is crucial for ensuring even cell attachment in a two‑dimensional monolayer (although LUHMES cells have also been shown to form 3D structures in other settings). These steps establish a culture that produces a well‑defined dopaminergic neuronal network by day 3, at which time the test compounds are applied and responses (neurite outgrowth and viability) are measured.

No details are provided in the documents regarding contaminating cell percentages or the composition of subpopulations in co‑cultures. The assay is conducted with a pure population of LUHMES cells (with an acceptable level of dead cells being around 5–10% as noted in section 3.4), and there is no information on the presence or proportions of additional cell types. Similarly, the documentation does not address whether any subpopulations (if present) exhibit differential sensitivity to cytotoxicity, nor does it provide data on specific chemicals or chemical classes showing differential cytotoxicity for distinct subpopulations of the test cells.

However, it lacks clarity and completeness as it does not specify analytical methods, acceptance criteria values, or historical controls. The criteria are not quantified, and there is no mention of actions if acceptance criteria are not met.","Acceptance of a given cell batch in the NeuriTox assay is mainly based on a set of morphological and viability‐related criteria that are assessed by visual inspection (and, where applicable, by high-content imaging). For example, before starting the 24‐h toxicant exposure, we check that:

• Cells used for the test are healthy, exhibit an oval morphology, and do not form extensive aggregates – with approximately 5–10% cell death (as judged by floating dead cells) for the source population. (See “Acceptance criteria for source cell population” in section 3.4 of the document.)

• At the start of the differentiation phase (i.e. just before treatment), the cells should display the expected morphology: the neurites should be approximately as long as the cell body when the cells are trypsinized for re‐plating. In addition, during the treatment step the cells are not yet fully attached – they still appear round when observed microscopically. Their confluency should be around 60% (see section 4.2 “Acceptance criteria for assessing the test system at its start”).

Analytical methods used to evaluate these endpoints include:

– Visual inspection using the high-content imaging system (Cellomics Array Scan Reader) after staining the cells with Hoechst H‑33342 (to label nuclei) and calcein‑AM (to label viable cells). This provides confirmation on cell viability and initial neurite formation.

– Although not routinely quantified by PCR or ATP measurement at the culture start, prior characterization (using gene expression for markers such as bIII‑tubulin) ensures the LUHMES cells are correctly differentiated and have the dopaminergic phenotype. However, for routine acceptance before toxicity testing the main readout is morphological (i.e. neurite length and cell shape) combined with overall viability based on the live/dead staining.

Historical experience shows that when differentiations are performed repeatedly (e.g. over 10 runs), cells consistently meet these criteria (i.e. about 60% confluency at treatment, cells with neurites roughly as long as their cell body, and only minimal cell death). If these criteria are not observed – for instance, if cells are overly confluent, show excessive cell death, or if neurite outgrowth is insufficient (i.e. neurites much shorter than the cell body) – this indicates a problem with plating, differentiation, or cell quality. In such cases the affected cell batch is discarded and the differentiation is repeated before proceeding with any toxicological testing.

It provides minimal and vague criteria for acceptance, lacks specific endpoints, parameters, or values, and does not mention historical controls or actions if criteria are not met. The response is incomplete and lacks clarity.","The assay relies on a few key quality criteria at both the source cell phase and in the test system used for compound evaluation. For the source cells, the cells must display an oval morphology and should not form extensive aggregates or clusters (Section 3.4). Up to about 5–10% cell death is acceptable, but if cell death is visibly increased one passage after thawing the batch is discarded. In addition, working stock cells are used only up to passage 18 to avoid changes in cellular behavior.

Once the cells are plated for testing, typical endpoints include:
• Before treatment (at re-plating), cells should already have initiated neurite outgrowth such that the neurites are approximately as long as the cell body. At this stage, cells typically are not yet fully attached but appear round on the plate, and the confluency is about 60% (Section 4.2).  
• After compound treatment (in the negative controls), visual inspection should reveal that the neurites remain at least as long as the cell bodies, the medium shows no signs of acidification (i.e. is not orange/yellow), and the cell density appears appropriate (Section 4.3).

In historical control experiments the negative control (0.1% DMSO) neurite area is expected to be well above a set threshold (e.g. ≥35,000 units), and typical intra-experimental variability in neurite outgrowth is on the order of 11.7 ± 4.5%, whereas viability varies by about 3.8 ± 3.5%. If experiments performed repeatedly (for example, over 10 differentiation rounds) show average control values that are far out of this range—a delayed or insufficient neurite extension or a markedly altered cell density—these experiments are discarded. For example, if the negative control neurite area drops below the acceptance benchmark (analogous to having average neurite lengths substantially shorter than expected), the whole experimental run is not accepted.

If any of these acceptance criteria are not met—whether due to poor cell morphology, excessive cell death, inadequate differentiation (i.e. neurite lengths not matching the cell body size), or abnormal culture parameters (such as overly confluent cultures or medium discoloration)—the respective experiment is discarded and the assay is repeated with new cells or adjusted plating/differentiation conditions.

However, it lacks specific details on critical consumables, handling steps, and controls with expected values and deviations. Recommendations for reproducibility are also not fully covered.","The assay documentation identifies several factors that can contribute to variability in the final test system state. These include:

1. Causes of variability and critical consumables/batch effects:  
 • Issues with coating: Variability can arise from differences in the batches of poly-L-ornithine (PLO) and fibronectin as well as inconsistencies in the water quality used for coating plastics. Inconsistent plastic ware (e.g. different plate lots or suppliers) can also affect cell distribution and confluency.  
 • Cell batch and passage variability: Differences between cell batches (working stock from different thawings) and an increased passage number (beyond passage 18) can change cell morphology and sensitivity.  
 • Medium components: Although not detailed for serum replacement in this assay, additives or substitutes (e.g., variations in medium supplements) may contribute to variability.  
  _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, Sections 3.5 and 4.4)_

2. Critical handling steps and influencing factors:  
 • Pipetting: Special care is needed during compound addition—errors in pipetting (e.g. tips not touching the well’s liquid surface) can lead to the droplet sticking on the well wall, thereby affecting the final compound concentration and exposure.  
 • Timing: The steps such as seeding, medium change, and compound addition must be performed quickly (e.g. minimal time at room temperature during cell seeding and medium change) to avoid additional stress or induced variability in the cells.  
 • Cell density: Proper seeding density is critical (target is 30,000 cells per well after replating) to ensure uniform cell attachment and confluency close to 60% at treatment. Deviations in cell density can influence neurite outgrowth and viability readouts.  
  _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, Sections 3.5, 4.1, and 6.5)_

3. Positive and negative controls and expected values:  
 • Positive control: Narciclasine is used at 50 nM. Its expected effects are to reduce neurite area to ≤75% of the DMSO (solvent) control while maintaining viability at ≥90% of the DMSO control.  
 • Negative control: The solvent control (0.1% DMSO) must yield a neurite area ≥35,000 and maintain normal cell viability.  
 • Variability acceptance: Intra-experimental baseline variability is reported around 11.7% (neurite outgrowth) and 3.8% (cell viability), while inter-experimental variability is about 15.3% and 4.3%, respectively. Variability in the positive control observations (run on each plate) has been observed (e.g. neurite area reduction ranging between 40% and 75% relative to control), so data points that deviate significantly are flagged as technical outliers.  
  _(Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, Sections 5.9 and 8.4)_

4. Recommendations to increase/ensure reproducibility and performance:  
 • Use consistent batches of critical reagents such as the coating solutions (PLO and fibronectin) and ensure water quality by following the same purification procedures every time.  
 • Keep cell passage numbers within the recommended range (up to passage 18 for working stocks) and closely monitor cell morphology during culture.  
 • Ensure rigorous operator training, particularly for fast and accurate pipetting using multichannel pipettes and multistepper devices.  
 • Document plate maps, pipetting steps, and environmental conditions (e.g. timing of medium changes and compound additions) to enable troubleshooting.  
 • Utilize positive (narciclasine) and negative (0.1% DMSO) controls on every plate to continuously monitor assay performance and accept only repeat runs that meet the defined criteria and variability limits.

However, several gaps remain in mimicking the full complexity of human brain tissue. For example, the cells are maintained as a 2D monolayer rather than in a 3D architecture. This means they lack many in vivo environmental cues such as the complex extracellular matrix, full cell‐cell interactions (for instance with astrocytes and microglia), and the degree of synaptic network connectivity that characterizes mature brain tissue. Additionally, although the cells can differentiate and extend neurites, synapse formation is not clearly recapitulated. These limitations indicate that while the assay is well‐suited to assess basic neurite outgrowth and viability, extrapolations to a fully functional human neuronal network must take into account their reduced structural and functional complexity compared to in vivo human tissue.

──────────────────────────────
Day –1: Proliferation Phase  
──────────────────────────────
• Cells are maintained as proliferating LUHMES cells in proliferation medium.  
• Cells are seeded into pre-coated vessels (flasks or plates) that have been coated overnight with a solution of poly-L-ornithine (PLO) and fibronectin.  
• The cells are freshly seeded (not confluent) to ensure optimal growth and to avoid over-confluence (confluence maintained between 40–85%).  
_(Source: Sections 3.6 and 4.1 in NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_

──────────────────────────────
Day 0: Initiation of Differentiation  
──────────────────────────────
• The proliferation medium is completely replaced with differentiation medium.  
• Differentiation medium contains tetracycline (to shut down v-myc expression) plus critical supplements: dibutyryl-cAMP and GDNF, which drive dopaminergic differentiation and neurite outgrowth.  
• No compounds are added at this stage; the medium change initiates the differentiation program.
_(Source: Sections 3.6 and 4.1 in NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_

──────────────────────────────
Day 2: Re-plating and Onset of Exposure  
──────────────────────────────
• Cells grown in T175 flasks (reaching ~30–40 Mio) are trypsinized and re-plated into coated 96‐well plates at 30,000 cells per well in 90 µl of differentiation medium WITHOUT cAMP and GDNF.  
  – This modified medium omits cAMP and GDNF to standardize the conditions before compound addition.  
• ~30 minutes to 2 hours after re-plating—once the cells have attached but still appear round—the test compounds are added (10 µl per well) at defined concentrations.  
• Note: No re‐addition of compounds occurs if a medium change is performed later; compound exposure is continuous for the 24‑h treatment period.
_(Source: Sections 3.6, 4.1 and 5.1 in NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)_

──────────────────────────────
Day 3: Sampling and Readout  
──────────────────────────────
• Approximately 23.5 hours post compound treatment, cells are live-stained using calcein-AM (to indicate viability) and Hoechst H‑33342 (to mark nuclei).  
• After a 30‑min staining incubation (at 37°C, 5% CO₂), cells are imaged using a high‑content screening microscope.
• At the end of the 24‑h treatment period (including staining), neurite outgrowth (neurite area) and cell viability are quantified.

Key Points Summary  
──────────────────────────────
– Coated vessels (using PLO/fibronectin) are essential both for initial plating (day –1) and re-plating (day 2).  
– Medium changes occur:
 • Day 0: from proliferation medium to differentiation medium (with tetracycline, cAMP, and GDNF).  
 • Day 2: cells are re-plated into 96‑well plates using differentiation medium without cAMP and GDNF before compound addition.  
– Compounds are added only once (after re-plating on day 2); there is no re‑addition during subsequent medium changes.  
– The overall exposure period is 24 hours (from compound addition on day 2 to readout on day 3).  

This timeline integrates the entire culture scheme—from freshly seeded proliferative cells through medium changes, controlled differentiation with critical supplements, re‐plating, and finally compound exposure and imaging—providing the necessary context for understanding the exposure scheme in this assay.

Exposure times are set manually.

Double positive cells are counted as viable.",Medium,"The answer provides a partial overview of the analytical method, including staining procedures and imaging details. However, it lacks a comprehensive description of the method's principles and key steps, such as whether cells are fixed or homogenized. It also does not address whether viability and neurite outgrowth are measured in the same well or under the same conditions. The explanation of the quantification algorithm is minimal, and there is no mention of the number of cells imaged.","The analytical approach is based on automated high‐content live-cell imaging performed after a 24‐h exposure period. In brief, the cells are not fixed but live‐stained with two dyes: Hoechst H‑33342 is used to stain nuclei (and thereby identify each cell) and calcein‑AM marks viable cells as well as their neuritic structures. Both endpoints—neurite outgrowth and cell viability—are measured simultaneously in the same well under identical conditions.

Key steps of the method include:
•  After 24‑h treatment, cells are incubated for 30 minutes with the staining reagents at 37°C and 5% CO2.
•  The stained cells are then imaged using a high-content microscope (Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS Reader) equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA‐ER camera. Ten fields per well are imaged in two separate channels (one for Hoechst and one for calcein).
•  For quantification, an image analysis algorithm identifies nuclei in the Hoechst channel. Around each nucleus the algorithm expands the nuclear contour by a pre‐defined distance (e.g. 3.2 µm) to create a virtual cell soma area. The calcein signal outside of this soma region is attributed to neurite outgrowth. Concurrently, viability is determined by measuring the calcein intensity within these expanded areas. Cells showing calcein intensities above validated thresholds are counted as viable.
•  These methods allow for both endpoints to be assessed in parallel from the same images, ensuring that neurite area and cell viability are obtained under exactly the same experimental conditions.

"Provide information on machine settings, analytical standards, data processing and normalization procedures. For imaging endpoints: provide detailed algorithm. This information should also be covered in an SOP, preferably in DB-ALM format (see link in 6.6).","Quantification of neurite outgrowth An automated microplate reading microscope (Array-ScanII HCS Reader, Cellomics, PA) equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera (resolution 1024 x 1024; run at 2 x 2 binning) was used for image acquisition. Ten fields per well were imaged. Images were recorded in 2 channels using a 20x objective and excitation/emission wavelengths of 365 ± 50/535 ± 45 to detect H-33342 in channel 1 and 474 ± 40/535 ± 45 to detect calcein in channel 2. In both channels, a fixed exposure time and an intensity histogram-derived threshold were used for object identification. Neurite pixels were identified using the following image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified as objects in channel 1 according to their size, area, shape, and intensity which were predefined on untreated cells using a machine-based learning algorithm, and manual selection of nuclei to be classified as intact. The nuclear outlines were expanded by 3.2 µm in each direction, to define a virtual cell soma area (VCSA) based on the following procedure: The average width of the cytoplasm ring (distance nucleus - cell membrane) of LUHMES cells was experimentally determined to be 2.3 µm. Size irregularities were not always due to growing neurites, as determined by combined F-actin/tubulin beta-III staining. To avoid scoring of false positive neurite areas, the exclusion ring (VCSA) was made bigger than the average cell size. Then, we used two control compounds (U0126 and bisindolylmaleimid I) to vary the expanded outlines from 0.6 to 4 µm. We found 3.2 µm to be optimal both to detect neurite growth over time and to identify reduced neurite growth with high sensitivity. All calcein-positive pixels of the field (beyond a given intensity threshold) were defined as viable cellular structures (VCSs). The threshold was dynamically determined for each field after flat field and background correction and intensity normalization to 512 gray values and was set to 12% of the maximal brightness (channel 63 of 512). The VCS defines the sum of all somata and neurites without their assignment to individual cells. In an automatic calculation, the VCSAs, defined in the H- 33342 channel, were used as filter in the calcein channel and subtracted from the VCS. The remaining pixels (VCS - VCSA) in the calcein channel were defined as neurite area. Quantification of individual viable cells by imaging For a quantitative assessment of viable cells, the same images used to assess neurite area were analysed using another image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified in channel 1 as objects according to their size, area, shape, and intensity. Nuclei of apoptotic cells with increased fluorescence were excluded. A VCSA was defined around each nucleus by expanding it by 0.3 µm into each direction. Calcein-AM staining, labelling live cells, was detected in channel 2. The algorithm quantified the calcein intensity in the VCSA areas. Cells having an average calcein signal intensity in the VCSAs below a predefined threshold were classified by the program as “not viable”. Valid nuclei with a positive calcein signal in their cognate VCSA were counted as viable cells. A positive calcein signal was based on measurements of the average intensity (normal cells: 1300 ± 115, threshold: < 50) and the total integrated intensity (normal cells: 186,000 ± 23,600, threshold < 1000) of cells.",Medium,"The answer provides detailed information on the machine settings, imaging endpoints, and algorithms used for image analysis, which partially addresses the question. However, it lacks information on analytical standards, data processing, and normalization procedures beyond the imaging context. Additionally, there is no mention of an SOP or the DB-ALM format, which are specifically requested in the question.","The assay’s image acquisition and analysis are carried out on a Cellomics Array Scan (VTI HCS Reader) equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA‐ER camera (1024 × 1024 pixels in 2 × 2 binning) using a 20× objective. Fixed exposure times and predefined excitation/emission wavelengths are applied in two channels: one channel detects Hoechst H‑33342 (excitation: 365 ± 50 nm/emission: 535 ± 45 nm) for nucleus/object identification and the other detects calcein (excitation: 474 ± 40 nm/emission: 535 ± 45 nm) for neurite and viability signals. The intensity values are normalized to 512 gray values after flat-field and background correction, with thresholds dynamically determined—for example, a threshold set to 12% of maximal brightness is used in the calcein channel.

For the imaging endpoints, the analysis algorithm works as follows:

• First, nuclei are identified in channel 1 based on preset criteria (size, area, shape, and intensity) that were calibrated using control (untreated) cells. A machine-learning algorithm, combined with manual selection, ensures that only intact nuclei are classified.

• The nuclear outlines are then expanded by 3.2 µm in every direction to create a virtual cell soma area (VCSA). This expansion exceeds the average cytoplasmic ring (experimentally determined as ~2.3 µm) to avoid false positives from soma signals.

• In the calcein (channel 2) images, all pixels with sufficient intensity (above the dynamically set threshold) are collected as viable cell structures (VCS). The algorithm subtracts the VCSA (nuclear area) from the VCS to define the neurite area—the pixels remaining after subtraction are counted as neurite outgrowth.

• For cell viability, the algorithm reanalyzes the same images: nuclei are again identified in the Hoechst channel (with apoptotic cells excluded). A much smaller expansion (0.3 µm in each direction) is applied to form a VCSA around each nucleus, and the calcein intensity within this region is measured. Cells falling below the predefined average intensity (e.g. <50) or total integrated intensity (<1000) thresholds are classified as nonviable. Only nuclei with a calcein-positive VCSA are counted as viable cells.

Data processing is performed by extracting the raw numerical data (e.g. neurite area, cell counts) from the Array Scan software. These data are then copied into Excel, further processed with KNIME and GraphPad Prism, where a four‑parameter log function is used for nonlinear regression (or a linear fit if necessary) to derive EC50 values and other endpoints. Outlier data (which are typically due to technical issues such as focus failure) are identified by visual inspection.

Additionally, it does not address whether pathway inhibitions or activations correlate with the test method response.","Below are three MCC that have been implemented in the NeuriTox assay:

1. Narciclasine  
 • Why MCC: Narciclasine activates the Rho pathway, thereby inhibiting neurite outgrowth. This biological effect is well‐documented and reproducibly decreases the neurite area without significantly affecting viability.  
 • Expected data: When used at 50 nM (the routine positive control concentration), neurite area is reduced to ≤75% of the DMSO control while cell viability remains at ≥90%. This makes it ideal for day‐to‐day assay performance monitoring and setting acceptance criteria.  
 (Reference: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, sections 5.5 and 5.9)

2. HA‑1077  
 • Why MCC: HA‑1077 is a Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor. By inhibiting ROCK, it enhances neurite outgrowth. Its use confirms that inhibition of the downstream Rho/ROCK pathway leads to an increase in neurite extension.  
 • Expected data: An increase in neurite area relative to controls, thereby demonstrating that pathway inhibition (ROCK suppression) correlates with enhanced neurite length.  
 (Reference: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, section 5.5)

3. Blebbistatine  
 • Why MCC: Blebbistatine inhibits myosin II activity, a key component of the Rho/ROCK/LIM kinase/cofilin pathway. This inhibition modulates cytoskeletal dynamics, favoring neurite outgrowth.  
 • Expected data: Enhanced neurite outgrowth as measured by an increased neurite area compared to control, supporting the link between cytoskeletal regulation and neurite extension.  
 (Reference: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, section 5.5)

Correlation between pathway modulation and test method response:  
Activation of the Rho pathway (e.g. with Narciclasine) leads to reduced neurite outgrowth, while inhibition of components in the Rho/ROCK/myosin II pathway (e.g. using HA‑1077 or Blebbistatine) results in enhanced neurite extension. This correlation confirms that the test method’s readout (neurite area) reflects biological processes modulated through these specific pathways.

It also does not address the quality of in vivo reference data or whether in vivo relevant threshold concentrations are known.","1. The assay uses the following positive controls:  
 • For neurite growth inhibition, narciclasine is used (at 50 nM final concentration), which acts via Rho activation.  
 • In addition, for neurite growth enhancement, compounds such as HA‑1077 (a Rho-associated kinase inhibitor) and blebbistatin (a myosin II inhibitor) are used.  
    
2. The expected data for the positive control (narciclasine) are that neurite area is reduced to ≤75% of the DMSO (solvent) control while cell viability remains ≥90% (i.e. not significantly changed). In a series of experiments, the neurite area relative to control was observed to vary between 40% and 75% across different test plates, indicating an inter-plate variation that can be considerable (the reported positive control variation was approximately 38.5%).  
    
3. Regarding in vivo reference data for these positive controls, the documents do not provide well‐defined in vivo threshold concentrations or a robust in vivo data set for these mechanistic control compounds. Thus, while the in vitro effects of narciclasine (and the related compounds for enhancement) are clear in this assay context, in vivo thresholds relevant for these endpoints are not established in the provided documentation.

If yes, indicate the compounds and the respective rationale for their use and the concentration selection.","Negative control: solvent (0.1% DMSO final concentration), mannitol, paracetamol, ASS, galloflavin.",Low,"The answer lists some chemicals used as negative controls but does not describe the expected data on such controls, the rationale for concentration settings, or whether unspecific controls are used. It lacks clarity and completeness in addressing the question.","The assay relies on a solvent‐negative control where cells are exposed to 0.1% DMSO (added as a vehicle) without any active test compound. Under these conditions, the “background” signal is defined by a neurite area of at least 35,000 (as assessed by high‐content imaging) and cell viability that remains essentially unchanged (typically ≥90% of the DMSO control) with the measured intra‑experimental variation being roughly 11.7 ± 4.5% for neurite outgrowth and 3.8 ± 3.5% for viability. This signal level and its uncertainty define the baseline noise of the method.

The rationale for setting the negative control concentration at 0.1% DMSO is to use a solvent concentration known not to interfere with cell viability or neurite formation so that it establishes a reliable background against which compound effects can be compared.

In addition to the standard solvent (DMSO) control, unspecific controls are also employed. These include compounds such as mannitol, paracetamol, ASS, and galloflavin. They are chosen because they are not expected to exert specific effects on neurite outgrowth, yet they help to further define the characteristics of unspecific (general cytotoxic) interference. Their concentrations are selected such that their effects (or non‐effects) are comparable to those observed with the vehicle control, ensuring that any deviations in neurite area or cell viability can be interpreted relative to a stable background signal.

• There is no discussion of potential challenges in distinguishing slowed proliferation from cell death.

• Similarly, the concept of early death followed by compensatory growth in the context of repeated or prolonged dosing is not addressed.

• For very short-term endpoints (for example, electrophysiology measured 30 minutes after toxicant exposure), the protocol does not indicate a provision for a delayed measure of cytotoxicity; cytotoxicity is determined at a 24‑hour time point.

Which rule do you apply to test whether a test run is within the normal performance frame? How do you document this decision? Indicate actions if the AC are not met.,Positive control narciclasine: Neurite area ≤ 75% of DMSO control Viability ≥ 90% of DMSO control (or not significantly changed) Negative control DMSO: Neurite area ≥ 35’000,Low,"The answer does not clearly address the question about the rule applied to test whether a test run is within the normal performance frame. It provides specific criteria for controls but lacks explanation on how these criteria are used to determine normal performance, how the decision is documented, and what actions are taken if acceptance criteria are not met.","The decision is made by checking whether the run meets the assay’s pre‐specified acceptance criteria (AC) as defined in section 5.9. In practice this means that the negative control must yield a minimum neurite area (≥35,000 as per the documented requirement) and the positive control (narciclasine at 50 nM) must reduce neurite area to ≤75% of the DMSO control while keeping viability at or above 90% of control. These quantitative criteria allow us to decide if the assay run is within its normal performance frame.

This decision is documented by recording the observed values alongside the preset acceptance thresholds in the laboratory records (such as paper lab books and electronic plate maps/Excel files) as part of the day-to-day documentation (see sections 6.2 and 7.2 of the protocol). If the AC are not met – for example, if the negative control’s neurite area falls below 35,000 or if the positive control does not show the required reduction with maintained viability – the run is flagged, the technical errors (e.g. pipetting issues or focus problems) are noted, and the run is then discarded and repeated after troubleshooting the identified issues.

However, it does not clearly address the possibility or extent of repeated measures over time from the same dish, which is part of the question. The explanation is also somewhat complex and could be clearer.","Based on the throughput estimate described in section 5.10 of the document, one “experiment” (i.e. complete set of technical replicates for all concentrations of a compound) yields 50 data points (5 compounds × 10 concentrations each), with all technical replicates counted as a single data point per condition. The text states that with 6 plates processed per day (i.e. 2 complete experiments or batches) and 3 days run per week, about 300 data points are generated per week. Using a four‐week month that would yield 1,200 data points; however, if you count only three working weeks per month, then the total is 3 × 300 = 900 data points per month. 

Regarding repeated measures from the same dish, the assay protocol is designed for a single imaging readout (after a 24‑h treatment) per dish. Although variations (e.g. later exposure or wash‐out experiments) are mentioned as possible adaptations, the standard protocol does not include repeated measures on the same dish over time. Thus, the readout is essentially taken only once per dish.

However, it lacks comprehensive information on the range of volumes, specific lab ware/instruments for dispensing, temperature/lighting considerations, and tests of solubility. Additionally, it does not fully address the decision rules for the solvent, filtering for sterility, or detailed procedures for the final addition to the test system.","Based on the provided document, the following details can be summarized:

1. Compound stocks are prepared by first dissolving the solid/powder compounds in DMSO. The DMSO is stored in a light‐proof, air‑tight bottle at room temperature, and the final concentration on the cells is adjusted to 0.1% DMSO. Once dissolved, compounds are aliquoted into volumes sufficient for one experiment (one biological replicate) to avoid repeated freeze–thaw cycles that can affect compound stability and efficiency. Storage follows the manufacturer’s recommendations (e.g. 4°C, room temperature, or –20°C) (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, section 6.1).

2. For the preparation of dilutions, a thawed compound aliquot is diluted in DMEM/F12 Advanced without supplements in a separate deepwell plate. The dilution scheme is set so that all dilutions initially contain 1% DMSO; for the highest compound concentration, the dilution is made 1:100 using medium without additional DMSO because the DMSO introduced during the compound dissolution already meets the 1% target. Serial dilution (typically 1:3, though steps can be adjusted to be narrower if desired) is then performed with the same medium (DMEM/F12 Advanced with 1% DMSO) (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, section 6.1).

3. There is no explicit mention of a filtration step for sterilizing the stock or dilution solutions. The protocol relies on aseptic handling and the compounds are prepared and aliquoted under controlled conditions to maintain sterility.

4. The final addition to the test system takes place on 96‑well plates. Here, LUHMES cells have been re‑plated at 30,000 cells per well in 90 µl of differentiation medium (without cAMP and GDNF). Then, approximately 30 minutes to 2 hours after seeding (when the cells have attached but may still appear round) the compounds are added. Dispensing is performed using a multichannel-multistepper pipette configured with filter tips (6 tips at a time). The pipette is set to take in 40 µl with a medium uptake speed and deliver 10 µl per well at a high output speed. Thus each well receives 10 µl of the compound dilution, resulting in a total volume of 100 µl per well (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, section 6.1).

5. Additional considerations include:
 • Temperature: The compound dilutions and the DMSO stock are maintained as recommended (DMSO in a lightproof bottle at room temperature; cells are handled quickly to minimize time at room temperature during seeding and medium changes).
 • Lighting: DMSO is protected from light by using a light‑proof container.
 • Lab ware/instruments: Deepwell plates are used for dilution preparation while 96‑well plates are used for the test system. The dispensing is performed with a multichannel-multistepper pipette equipped with filter tips.
 • Decision rules include ensuring that the final DMSO concentration on cells is 0.1% and that the dilution medium (DMEM/F12 Advanced) contains 1% DMSO during the dilution steps to correctly achieve the intended final concentration.
 • The protocol does not detail any specific tests of solubility in the culture medium or as stocks, but good solubility and homogeneity are implied by the requirement to avoid repeated freeze–thaw cycles and the use of DMSO as a solvent.

In summary, compound stocks are prepared in DMSO (stored under light‐protected conditions), aliquoted for single use, and then diluted in DMEM/F12 Advanced (with a built‑in 1% DMSO background) in a deepwell plate. The final 10 µl of each dilution is added to re‑plated cells in 96‑well plates after cell attachment using a multichannel pipette, yielding a final well volume of 100 µl and a final DMSO concentration of 0.1% (Sources: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, sections 6.1 and 6.4).",0.7977630489486935,0.27879834175109863,0.08636599034070969,0.17853477597236633

However, it lacks detailed information on the time plan of pipetting, adherence to plate maps, routine procedures for documenting intermediate steps, and the specific pattern for using plate wells. It also does not mention the inclusion of information in an SOP or the DB-ALM format.","The pipetting schedule is planned in advance and integrated into the overall experimental design. Before starting the experiment, the plate maps (including the well sequence and compound concentrations) are created and then documented in both a paper lab book and in Excel files on the work group server. This predefinition ensures that the pipetting order is clear and can be followed day‐to‐day (see Sections 6.2 and 6.3 of NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf).

During pipetting, after preparing compound dilutions, the compounds are added using a multichannel-multistepper pipette with preset speeds (uptake set to medium, output set to high). In practice, technical replicates are pipetted sequentially from left to right, with the highest concentration starting in the leftmost column. Any deviation from the planned plate map, such as pipetting errors (for example, pipetting twice in one well), is immediately marked directly on the plate maps. These errors and any other intermediate mistakes or uncertainties (including potential pipetting irregularities) are documented in the paper lab book while the experiment is in progress. The lab book, which is carried to the cell culture rooms, serves as the primary record for any error annotation at the time of the experiment (see Sections 6.2 and 6.3 of NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf).

It also does not mention any SOP or DB-ALM format documentation.","The default approach is to use a serial dilution—specifically, a 1:3 dilution series spanning ten different concentrations, which covers a 19,683‑fold range (for example, from about 20 µM down to 1 nM) (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, section 6.4). The starting (highest) concentration is defined based on the compound’s solubility (with the compound first dissolved in 100% DMSO, then diluted so that the final DMSO concentration on the cell is 0.1%). In practice, the highest compound concentration is prepared with a 1:100 dilution in medium before initiating the serial dilution (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, section 6.4).

For functional endpoints where a full concentration–response is not observed, if the viability endpoint does not reach, for instance, the benchmark response level (such as BMC25), the highest tested concentration (HTC) is used in the prediction model (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, section 8.3). In other cases (e.g., for gene expression endpoints), concentrations like an EC10 derived from viability data are sometimes employed as reference points (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, sections 8.3 and 8.4). Detailed procedures for defining and applying these concentration ranges—including all dilution factors and calculation approaches—are laid out in the standard operating procedure available in DB‑ALM format (see section 6.6 for the DB‑ALM protocol link).

Thus, the concentration range is defined via a default ten‑point 1:3 serial dilution with rules on starting concentration set by solubility and solvent considerations, and for endpoints that do not yield a full response, the highest tested concentration (or a derived EC value) is used.

It also describes known pitfalls and potential operator mistakes, providing a complete and relevant response.","The assay documentation points out several issues regarding compound properties, experimental variables, and critical handling steps:

1. Problematic compounds:  
 • Some compounds show low solubility during stock preparation and dilution (stock must be prepared in 100% DMSO and then diluted so that the final DMSO concentration on cells remains 0.1%).  
 • Certain compounds exhibit autofluorescence that interferes with the detection of calcein-AM or Hoechst H-33342, potentially skewing the imaging readouts.  
 • Though not explicitly mentioned as “precipitation of medium components,” the protocol emphasizes attention to compound solubility which could lead to precipitation issues if not handled correctly.  
  _(Source: EFSA NAMs Case Study on Tebufenpyrad, Part 2 – Annex A, sections 6.1 and 6.5)_

2. Experimental variables that are hard to control:  
 • Variability in fluorescent signals due to compound autofluorescence can make proper detection challenging.  
 • Focusing issues with the high-content imaging system (Cellomics Array Scan VTI HCS Reader) may occur; failure in proper focusing or imaging one channel only can lead to outlier results.  
  _(Source: EFSA NAMs Case Study on Tebufenpyrad, Part 2 – Annex A, section 6.5)_

3. Critical handling steps and potential pitfalls:  
 • Compound addition: It is essential to add compounds with the pipette tip touching the wall of the well, immediately above the medium surface. Pipetting too high may cause droplets to stick to the wall, leading to uneven compound distribution.  
 • Cell seeding and medium changes must be performed quickly (minimizing time at room temperature) to maintain cell health and assay consistency.  
 • The plastic coating (PLO and fibronectin) on plates and flasks is critical for even cell distribution. Variability in coating quality, differences in consumable batches, or issues with water quality (e.g., using PBS instead of the recommended MilliQ water) can cause cell clumping and uneven distribution.  
 • Operator training is crucial. The protocol requires experience with LUHMES cell culture and automated pipetting. Inadequate handling, subsequent pipetting errors, or delays between steps lead to increased variability.  
 • Differences in cell passage number or cell density (too low or too high confluence) can introduce variability in cell behavior and assay performance.  
  _(Source: EFSA NAMs Case Study on Tebufenpyrad, Part 2 – Annex A, sections 3.5, 6.5, and 6.6)_

4. Robustness issues:  
 • Operator variability plays a significant role; the assay requires approximately 4 weeks of training to ensure smooth performance.  
 • Consumable variations, such as differences between lots of plastic ware or coating agents, have been noted as causes of variability.  
 • Seasonal or environmental factors are not explicitly detailed but can be inferred from issues with coating stability (e.g., storing coated plates in the fridge versus using them immediately) and media quality.

In summary, low solubility, autofluorescence of certain compounds, and technical issues with imaging are among the key physical/chemical challenges. Additionally, critical steps such as proper pipetting technique, immediate and precise cell seeding/medium change, proper plastic coating, and operator training are essential to minimize variability and ensure robust assay performance.",0.8160925722352669,0.21767467260360718,-0.004807901103049517,0.09958486258983612

b) For the same endpoints, alternative analytical methods can be used. Besides high‐content imaging, cell viability can be quantified by fluorimetric assays detecting resazurin conversion, by measuring extracellular LDH release, or via ATP luminescence assays. (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)

c) The exposure scheme can be modified as well. For example, after a 24‑h exposure, compounds can be washed out and cells can be imaged on a later day (e.g. day 4). In addition, prolonged exposures or later exposures (from day 5 on) can be implemented to investigate the effects on more mature neurite networks. Furthermore, changing the medium composition to one containing galactose instead of glucose can increase the sensitivity to mitochondrial toxicants. (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)

d) Other experimental variations include using different protocols to record neurite growth. One variant involves employing GFP‐labelled cells to monitor this endpoint. Also, the test system can be adjusted by incorporating specific inhibitors or substrates—such as modulators of the Rho/ROCK pathway—to examine pathway‐specific effects on neurite outgrowth.

• UKN3a – “Assay to test compound‑derived neurite integrity impairment in human mature dopaminergic neurons after long‑term compound exposure” (database protocol number 202 in DB‑ALM). This assay is designed to measure neurite integrity in mature, fully differentiated human dopaminergic neurons following long‑term exposure. Compared to UKN4, which assesses neurite outgrowth in differentiating neurons at an early developmental stage (day 2–3), UKN3a uses a mature neuronal system and a longer exposure period.

• UKN3b – “Assay to test compound‑derived neurite integrity impairment in human mature dopaminergic neurons” (database protocol number 196 in DB‑ALM). Similar to UKN3a, it is applied to mature dopaminergic neurons to evaluate compound effects on neurite integrity. Again, the key difference is that UKN3b is used on a mature system, in contrast to the differentiating cells used in the present method (UKN4).

In addition, high throughput transcriptomics has been applied as an alternative endpoint: the LUHMES differentiation process in UKN4 has been characterized by generating a complete transcriptome dataset deposited in the EBI database under accession-ID S-TOXR1833, which can serve as an alternative endpoint for molecular profiling of the neurodevelopmental process.

The response is incomplete and lacks clarity on the data processing workflow.","Raw data from the assay are processed in several defined steps. First, the Array Scan VTI HCS Reader acquires images in two channels (Hoechst for nuclei and calcein for viable cells and neurites). The built-in image analysis software first performs flat‐field and background correction and intensity normalization (to 512 gray values). For the calcein channel, a dynamically determined intensity threshold (set at 12% of the maximal brightness) is applied. Then, using the Hoechst channel, nuclei are identified and a virtual cell soma area (VCSA) is defined (by expanding the nuclear outline by a preset distance) so that calcein-positive pixels outside this area are quantified as neurite area. Simultaneously, nuclei coupled with a positive calcein signal within the VCSA are counted as viable cells. (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, sections 5.4 “Technical details”)

Next, the processed image-derived data (neurite area and cell counts) from all technical replicates are collated by copy‐pasting them into an Excel worksheet. Further data processing is then carried out using tools such as KNIME and GraphPad Prism. In this step, data from treated samples are normalized relative to untreated controls (for example, solvent [0.1% DMSO] treated wells). This normalization expresses endpoints (e.g. neurite area and viability) as percentages relative to control conditions, with any background signal (for example, from medium controls) having been subtracted during the initial background correction.

For concentration–response analysis, the normalized data are fitted using a least‐squares nonlinear regression—typically by a four-parameter log function. In the case of scenarios where a nonlinear fit is not feasible, a linear fit is applied. The EC50 is determined by solving the fitted curve for 50% of the total scale (and not simply 50% of the min–max range). In addition, ratios (such as those used for Benchmark Concentration [BMC] calculations and points of departure [PoD]) are derived from these normalized datasets. Benchmark concentrations (with their upper and lower confidence intervals, BMCU and BMCL) are calculated using external software (BMCeasy) available online. Additional statistical analyses (e.g. one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-test or two-way ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer post hoc testing) may be applied to compare deviations in neurite outgrowth against viability.

In summary, the complete data processing workflow is as follows:
1. Image acquisition with dual-channel imaging.
2. Image analysis including flat field/background correction, intensity normalization, and object (nuclei and neurite) identification.
3. Extraction and collation of numerical data into Excel.
4. Normalization of treated data to control data (background and medium controls are subtracted during image processing).
5. Nonlinear (or linear, if necessary) curve fitting using GraphPad Prism to generate concentration–response curves and derive EC50 values.
6. Calculation of benchmark concentrations (BMCs) and ratios using specialized software (BMCeasy) and application of appropriate statistical tests.

"How are data normally handled to obtain the overall test result (e.g. concentration response fitting using model X, determination of EC50 by method Y, use of EC50 as final data)? How do you model your concentration response curve (e.g. LL.4 parameter fit) and which software do you use (e.g. GraphPad Prism, R, etc.)? Do you usually calculate an uncertainty measure of your summary data (e.g. a 95% confidence interval for the BMC or a BMCL), and with which software? Can you give uncertainty for non-cytotoxicity or no-effect? How do you handle non-monotonic curve shapes or other curve features that are hard to describe with the usual mathematical fit model?","The data are analyzed with Excel and represented with GraphPad Prism. For the concentration curve, a nonlinear regression fit is calculated. The fitting method is least squares. If a non-linear curve fit is not possible, a linear curve fit is performed. The curve deriving from the fit is a 4-parameter log function. To calculate the EC50 value, this log-function is solved for y=50% of the total scale, not for 50% of the min-max scale (see example below). Treated concentrations are analyzed for deviation from control. Sometimes it is analyzed whether the deviation of neurite growth is different from the deviation of viability. This is done by two-way ANOVA + Tukey-Kramer post hoc testing. Statistics applied are one-way ANOVA (and nonparametric) with Dunnett’s post test. BMC values with their upper and lower confidence intervals (BMCU and BMCL) are calculated via the publically available online software: http://invitrotox.uni-konstanz.de/BMCeasy/",Medium,"The answer provides some details on data handling, such as using Excel and GraphPad Prism for analysis and a nonlinear regression fit for concentration curves. It mentions the use of a 4-parameter log function and statistical tests like ANOVA. However, it lacks clarity on how non-monotonic curves are handled and does not fully address uncertainty measures for non-cytotoxicity or no-effect. The mention of BMC values and confidence intervals is relevant but not comprehensive enough to fully address all aspects of the question.","Data handling starts with image acquisition of stained cells using the high‐content Cellomics system, after which the raw data (neurite area and cell viability) are exported into Excel files and further processed with KNIME and GraphPad Prism. In GraphPad Prism the concentration–response curves are generally modeled using a nonlinear regression with least‐squares fitting employing a 4‐parameter log (LL.4 parameter) function. In those instances where a standard nonlinear regression is not suitable (e.g. if the data do not follow a typical sigmoidal profile), a linear curve fit is applied instead.

For effect quantification, the EC50 is determined by solving the fitted 4‐parameter log function at 50% of the total scale (not simply 50% of the min–max range). In addition, uncertainty measures are calculated; for instance, benchmark concentration (BMC) values are derived together with their lower (BMCL) and upper (BMCU) confidence intervals using the publicly available BMCeasy online tool. This approach also applies to endpoints where there is no clear cytotoxicity or no effect, in which cases the highest tested concentration is used when a BMC25 cannot be directly determined.

These methods ensure that even non-monotonic curve shapes or challenging data features are handled either by switching to a linear fit or by careful documentation of technical outliers, thereby supporting robust data interpretation.

The test specifically models the following:

• Toxicological target: Central nervous system dopaminergic neurons. These neurons, derived from LUHMES cells, are representative of human brain cells, especially those controlling motor functions.

• Biological processes: The assay models neurite outgrowth—which is essential for neuronal network formation—and aspects of neuronal differentiation. In parallel, it measures cellular viability to distinguish specific effects on neurite formation from general cytotoxicity.

• Toxicological events: It reflects events such as disturbance in neurite outgrowth (which may indicate cytoskeletal impairment or disruptions in cellular signaling) and, secondarily, cell viability/death if a compound broadly affects cell health.

• Human adverse outcomes: Since correct neurite outgrowth and network formation are critical for brain development and neuronal functionality, the test is related to outcomes like developmental neurotoxicity (which can lead to developmental disorders in children) and neurodegeneration. Notably, it has been linked in the literature to adverse outcomes such as parkinsonian motor deficits.

• Predicted hazards: The method is designed to predict hazards related to compounds that specifically impair neurite formation without necessarily affecting cell viability (as defined by the prediction models in the assay). This includes hazards that could lead to developmental neurotoxicity as well as adult neurotoxic effects mediated by disturbances in dopaminergic signaling.

Additionally, the answer does not fully explain the toxicological rationale or provide a detailed explanation of the 'hit' definition in screening mode.","Below is a summary of the benchmark response statistics and thresholds as described for the NeuriTox assay (UKN4) (Sources: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf):

1. Dichotomized outcomes (two classes: toxic versus non‑toxic)  
 • The screening prediction model defines a toxic response if the neurite area is reduced to ≤80% of the DMSO control while cell viability remains ≥90% of control.  
 • In this binary classification, a compound is considered toxic (a “hit”) when it causes a specific decrease in neurite outgrowth without overt cytotoxicity.  
 • Typical baseline variability for neurite outgrowth is reported as an intra‑experimental coefficient of variation of about 11.7% (SD ≈4.5%), and for viability around 3.8% (SD ≈3.5%).  

2. Pseudo‑dichotomized outcomes (three classes: non‑toxic, borderline, toxic)  
 • Borderline compounds are defined using a ratio derived from benchmark concentration (BMC25) estimates: the ratio of BMC25 for viability to BMC25 for neurite area.  
 • A ratio equal to or exceeding 4 is used to classify a compound as specifically neurotoxic, whereas values near this cutoff are considered “borderline.”  
 • In cases where viability does not reach the BMC25 threshold, the highest tested concentration (HTC) is used for the ratio calculation.  

3. Multi‑class or continuous outcomes  
 • Concentration–response relationships are fitted using a four‐parameter logarithmic model.  
 • For defining thresholds, a 25% effect level (BMC25) is used rather than a 50% effect because in routine experiments a moderate (∼25%) reduction in neurite area is more frequently observed given the test concentration range.  
 • The rationale is twofold: mathematically, the 25% effect is reliably detectable within the inherent variability, and biologically, the positive control (narciclasine) consistently produces neurite area reductions in the range of 40–75% of control while maintaining high viability.  

Rationale and Toxicological Basis for the Threshold  
 • The thresholds are partly based on the observed baseline variation (e.g. ∼12% for neurite outgrowth, ∼4% for viability) and the responses elicited by a known positive control (narciclasine).  
 • The 80% neurite area cutoff ensures that only compounds that cause a pronounced decrease in neurite outgrowth (with minimal impact on viability) are flagged for their potential developmental neurotoxicity.  
 • This approach is supported by both mathematical considerations—where a moderate reduction is statistically robust—and a biological rationale, as the assay was designed to capture neurite impairment as a key event in neurotoxic processes.  

Limitations of the Prediction Model  
 • The assay focuses on neurite outgrowth in dopaminergic neurons and may not capture other neurotoxic mechanisms.  
 • In some experiments, certain compounds do not reach the BMC25 for viability, necessitating use of the highest tested concentration as a surrogate.  
 • Variability issues (e.g. differences in plasticware coatings, compound solubility, or autofluorescence) may affect endpoint sensitivity or data interpretation.  
 • Sensitivity and specificity, while high (with reported sensitivity >90% and specificity around 82.7% in one DNT battery evaluation), are limited by the test’s compound set and the fact that not all neurotoxic endpoints are captured.  

Hit Definition in Screening Mode  
 • In a screening scenario, a “hit” is called when a compound causes neurite area to drop below or equal to 80% of control while viability remains at or above 90% of control. This definition is applied to flag compounds for further, more detailed evaluation using the refined prediction models.

The use of the updated prediction model BMC25 Viability (V) / BMC25 Neurite Area (NA) ≥ 4 was validated by comparing classifications derived by the initial and the updated prediction model. The reason for updating the prediction model was that a decrease of 50% in neurite area and viability cannot always be achieved with our range of test concentrations. An effect of 25% is more often observed and came to similar results when applied (Delp et al., 2018).",Medium,"The answer provides some relevant information about the setup and testing of the prediction model, including the chemicals used and references to documentation. However, it lacks clarity and completeness in addressing all aspects of the question, such as the specific classifiers/statistical approaches used, how data in the opposite direction are handled, and whether different rules apply to two-sided predictions. The explanation of sensitivity/specificity is also incomplete.","1. Setup of the prediction model  
• The model was established using a small, well‐characterized panel of compounds. Specifically, the training set included established neurite‐outgrowth inhibitors as positive controls—colchicine, vincristine, and nocodazole—and several unspecific toxicants affecting general viability such as etoposide, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), cycloheximide, paraquat, CCCP, 2,4‑DNP, SDS, tween‑20, K₂CrO₄, H‑33352, and tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (tBuOOH).  
• The approach was not based on a complex machine‐learning classifier but rather on defined threshold criteria (for example, a screening hit is defined as a decrease/increase in neurite area with maintained viability, such as neurite area ≤80% of DMSO control with viability ≥90% of control, and in the hazard evaluation stage by a ratio of BMC25 values: BMC25 Viability/BMC25 Neurite Area ≥4).  
(Retrieved from Sections 8.2 and 8.3 of the NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)

2. Testing of the prediction model  
• The prediction model was subsequently applied to screen an 80‑compound library from the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) (Delp et al., 2018) and to a 120‑compound library in a follow‑up study (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020).  
• (Since more than 50 compounds were used in these screens, one may state “n = 80” in one case and “n = 120” in the other.)

3. Documentation of the process  
• The process of setting up and documenting the model is described in the publications by Stiegler et al. (2011) and Krug et al. (2013).  
(Retrieved from Section 8.3)

4. One- versus two-sided application of the prediction model  
• The screening model is defined as a “hit” when there is a change in neurite area (either decrease or increase) while viability remains essentially unchanged. This indicates that the model is conceptually two-sided regarding the neurite area readout.  
• However, the hazard evaluation step is based on a ratio (BMC25 Viability/BMC25 Neurite Area ≥4) focusing on a selective effect on neurite area. In practice, most toxicants cause a decrease in neurite area, and the assay is primarily set up to capture inhibitory (downward) effects relative to the control.  
• In the documentation, there is no detailed description of different thresholds or performance characteristics for upward versus downward changes. An increase in neurite area (as seen with specific neurite-enhancing controls such as HA‑1077 and blebbistatine) is also used as an indicator but is handled under the general “hit” definition (change without a significant viability drop). The interpretation, performance, and thresholds are not reported as differing between an increase and a decrease in neurite area.  
(Retrieved from Sections 8.2 and 8.3)

In summary, the prediction model was set up using a defined training set of both specific neurite inhibitors (colchicine, vincristine, nocodazole) and unspecific toxicants (e.g. etoposide, BSO, cycloheximide, paraquat, etc.), with threshold-based criteria (using BMC25 ratios) instead of established statistical classifiers. It has been tested on 80 and 120 compound sets (n = 80 and n = 120, respectively) and the process is documented in publications by Stiegler et al. (2011) and Krug et al. (2013). The screening criteria cover both increases and decreases in neurite area with maintained viability, though in practice the assay is mainly tuned to detect decreases in neurite outgrowth as an indication of neurotoxicity, and no differential rules for upward versus downward changes are detailed.

Several performance parameters for the test were obtained in several separate evaluation rounds. A first evaluation was done during the first publication of the model and its applications (Stiegler et al. 2011, Krueg et al. 2013). Here, a panel of well-selected positive and negative controls have been tested. Accordingly, the specificity was 100% and the sensitivity was > 90 %. In dedicated experiments, S/N ratios of > 20 and a z’ of > 0.5 have been determined. The compound narciclasine (run on each plate as positive control) was tested across 36 different test plates and 12 independent assay runs. The neurite area relative to the solvent control varied between 40% and 75% across all plates with a viability value constantly >90% (Delp et al. 2018). The test has been used in screening campaigns, and real-live performance data under broader screen conditions have been obtained. The different performance data need to be considered, when a compound is a hit in a screen, or whether it has been specifically evaluated in a hit follow-up or a mechanistic project. A first screen application has been the NTP80 screen (80 compounds provided by the US NTP). Data are published Delp et al. 2018. A second screen application has been the cross systems case study of the EU-ToxRisk project. The baseline variation is indicated in Krebs et al., 2020. Moreover, an overview is given for 19 compounds on the BMC/BMCL ratio as measure of readout certainty. A third screen was performed in the context of the EFSA DNT test battery evaluation with 120 compounds (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). From this screen the following performance indicators were obtained: A: Sensitivity: 100%  With NeuriTox as standalone assay in 17 `tool negatives´ tested (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). B: Specificity: 82.7%  With NeuriTox combined in a full DNT battery and a selected set of 27 positive compounds with evidence for DNT (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). C: Baseline variation (intra-experimental) Neurite outgrowth: 11.7 ± 4.5% Cell viability: 3.8 ± 3.5% D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) Neurite outgrowth: 15.3% Cell viability: 4.3% E: Variation of a positive control run on each (inter-experimental) Neurite outgrowth: 38.5% Definition of values C-E C: Baseline variation (intra-experimental) is the mean CV±SD of the CV of all replicates of the solvent control from each experiment across n>200 experiments. D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) is the variability across all independent experiments (n>200) after normalization based on the response of the lowest test concentration. It was assumed that the lowest test concentration does not affect any of the endpoints measured. E: Variation of a positive control run on each (inter-experimental) is the variability of the positive control across all independent experiments (n>40) after normalization. Example for a positive control that on average reduced the specific endpoint down to 40% (relative to solvent control) and a calculated variability of 50%: 0.5 x 40% = +/- 20%  The positive control with mean of 40% varies from 20% to 60%.",High,"The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the test method's performance parameters, including specificity, sensitivity, signal/noise ratio, z-factor, baseline variation, and inter-operator variations. It also references multiple studies and data sources, offering detailed information on how these parameters were determined. The inclusion of historical control data and performance indicators from various screening campaigns further supports the completeness and relevance of the response.","Below are the preliminary performance parameter estimates derived from the assay documentation (NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf):

1. Baseline (noise) variations:  
 • Intrinsic (intra‐experimental) variation is quantified as a coefficient of variation (CV) of 11.7 ± 4.5% for neurite outgrowth and 3.8 ± 3.5% for cell viability, based on >200 experiments.  
 • Between (inter‐experimental) variation is 15.3% for neurite outgrowth and 4.3% for cell viability.  
 • In addition, the inter‐experimental variation of the positive control (narciclasine) for neurite area is about 38.5% (using a calculation where 0.5 × 40% ≈ ±20% variation around an average of 40%).  
  _(Source: Section 8.4 Test performance)_

2. Signal/noise ratio and z‑factor:  
 • The positive control (narciclasine) yields signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios of >20.  
 • A z′-factor of >0.5 has been determined.  
  _(Source: Section 8.4 Test performance)_

3. Specificity and sensitivity:  
 • Specificity is reported as 100% when evaluated against a panel of well-selected positive and negative controls.  
 • Sensitivity is >90%. Determination was based on dedicated experiments using positive control compounds (e.g. narciclasine) and comparing effects on neurite area versus viability.  
  _(Source: Section 8.4 Test performance)_

4. Uncertainty measures:  
 • Uncertainty is captured by the baseline variation figures (intra‐experimental and inter‐experimental CVs), and by the variation observed for the standard positive control across >40 independent runs. Outlier data (typically from technical issues like focusing errors) are noted and stored, although no formal mathematical outlier exclusion criterion has been defined.  
  _(Source: Sections 8.4 Test performance and 7.2 Outliers)_

5. Detection limit / LOQ:  
 • While an explicit limit of detection (LOD) or limit of quantification (LOQ) are not provided, the assay acceptance criteria note that for a negative control, neurite area should be ≥35,000 and that the prediction model is based on detecting a 25% change in the neurite area. Thus, a reduction of approximately 25% in neurite outgrowth (with viability maintained at ≥90% of control) appears to be the threshold for measurable change.  
  _(Source: Sections 5.9 Acceptance criteria and 8.3 Prediction model)_

6. Inter-operator variation and historical controls:  
 • The documentation does not provide a numerical quantification of inter-operator variation. However, it is noted that operators need approximately 4 weeks of training to achieve reproducible assay performance.  
 • Historical control data have been collected over more than 200 independent experiments, allowing for robust estimates of intra- and inter-experimental variation as detailed above.

The test has not been used extensively for IVIVE. However, data from the cell model (but different exposure scheme) have been used for IVIVE modelling (Loser et al., 2021, b).

No special considerations known.",Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing information on lipid and albumin content, which is relevant for determining free compound concentrations. It also mentions the use of the test for IVIVE and references some literature. However, it lacks details on protein content, cell volume, medium volume, surface area of the culture dish, and specific considerations for IVIVE such as compound accumulation or xenobiotic metabolism capacity.","Below is a summary of the available information from NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf:

1. Determination of free compound concentrations depends on the composition of the medium. In section 8.5 it is stated that the test medium has an estimated lipid content of 2.9 mg/l and an albumin (protein) concentration of 5.8 µM. In comparison, human plasma contains roughly 6000 mg/l lipids and 600 µM albumin. These differences are used to calculate the free (unbound) fraction from the nominal concentration (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, section 8.5).

2. The documentation does not provide explicit numbers for the cell volume or the lipid/protein content of the cells. There are also no specific values provided for the cell volume in culture.

3. Regarding culture dish dimensions, under the exposure scheme it is noted that on day 2 cells are re-plated onto 96‑well plates at 30,000 cells/well in 90 µl. After cell attachment, an additional 10 µl (compound dilution) is added, giving a total medium volume of 100 µl per well. The surface area of these wells is not explicitly stated, but the protocol clearly relies on standard 96‑well plate dimensions (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, sections 5.1 and 6.4).

4. On the topic of IVIVE:  
  a. There is literature and data indicating that the cell model has been used for IVIVE modelling. In section 8.5 it is mentioned that although the test has not been used extensively for IVIVE, data from the LUHMES cell model (albeit with a different exposure scheme) have been applied for IVIVE modelling (referencing Loser et al., 2021, Klose et al., 2021, and van der Stel et al., 2021).  
  b. No further special considerations are reported. The documentation does not mention issues such as compound accumulation due to frequent medium changes and re-addition, nor does it discuss aspects like glycoprotein (MDR1) expression or xenobiotic metabolism capacity of the test system.

In summary, key parameters for determining free compound concentrations include the medium’s lipid (2.9 mg/l) and albumin (5.8 µM) content. Apart from using standard 96‑well plate conditions (100 µl medium/well, with the precise surface area implied by typical well dimensions), no specific cell volume or cellular lipid/protein content is given. Regarding IVIVE, although the test system has been referenced in IVIVE modelling studies, there are no special IVIVE-related concerns mentioned in the document.

• The assay is designed to reliably flag compounds that specifically impair neurite outgrowth without severely reducing viability. For instance, it correctly detects compounds such as microtubule‐disrupting agents (e.g. colchicine, vincristine, nocodazole) and uses narciclasine as a positive control (with neurite area ≤80% of control while viability remains ≥90%). In contrast, compounds that affect general viability or cause unspecific cytotoxicity may not be clearly classified as specific “hits” by the prediction model.

• The document does not provide any information on how the test method reacts to mixtures or UVCBs. (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf)

• In terms of compound chemistry and suitability, the assay works well with agents that disrupt neurite formation (that is, cytoskeletal toxicants and certain signaling modifiers) but it is less suitable for compounds that do not affect neurite outgrowth specifically. For example, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and HDAC inhibitors have been reported to show no effect in the assay. Furthermore, since the assay relies on fluorescence-based imaging (calcein-AM and Hoechst 33342), fluorescent or strongly colored chemicals may interfere with endpoint detection. Thus, compounds that are inherently fluorescent or colored could be problematic. (Source: NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf, sections 6.5 and 8.6)

• Because the assay is based on human dopaminergic neurons expressing the dopamine transporter (DAT) and related neuronal markers, compounds acting via pathways not present—such as endocrine disruptors in the absence of their respective receptors or neurotransmitters for receptors that are not expressed—cannot be reliably detected.

It also mentions its implementation in a DNT battery and its preferential use in the first tier without complementary assays. However, it lacks a comprehensive discussion on potential weaknesses, restrictions, and gaps filled in a test battery, and does not fully explore the test's role in a broader test battery context.","The NeuriTox assay (UKN4) is designed as a component of a developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing battery. In its documentation the assay is described as having been integrated into a full DNT battery (see section 8.7 and section 9.3 of NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf). Specifically, its performance was compared – for example, when combined with a set of 27 positive DNT compounds, it achieved a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 82.7% (source: section 8.7 and 9.3).

Strengths in a testing battery include:
• It has medium to high throughput with automated high-content imaging.
• It offers a mechanistically and quantitatively robust endpoint by specifically measuring neurite outgrowth in human dopaminergic neurons. This readout is particularly relevant for addressing key events established in adverse outcome pathways such as AOP3 (source: sections 8.7 and 8.3).
• It has been successfully used as a screening and confirmation assay, with positive controls (e.g. narciclasine) demonstrating clear inhibition of neurite outgrowth while maintaining viability, making it good for alert generation and mechanistic follow-up (source: sections 8.1, 8.2, and 5.9).

Comparing to similar tests, such as the UKN5 assay (which addresses neurite outgrowth in peripheral neurons), UKN4 is specific for central nervous system dopaminergic neurons. This specialization is an advantage because it targets a cell type that expresses the dopamine transporter (DAT) and is relevant for conditions like parkinsonian motor deficits (source: section 8.7). However, a limitation is that—as a single-endpoint assay—it does not cover all aspects of neurotoxicity observed in vivo. Thus, while it is highly sensitive to neurite outgrowth perturbations, it may miss effects on other neuronal features or functions.

In terms of its placement in a testing strategy, the documentation suggests that the NeuriTox assay is best used as a first-tier test in a DNT battery. It is sufficiently robust to generate alerts on potential neurotoxicants and to confirm hits. In many cases it can be used as a stand-alone method for initial screening, although complementary assays—targeting other neuronal endpoints such as synaptogenesis, electrophysiological activity, or additional markers of viability—might be necessary to cover the full spectrum of neurotoxicity.

In summary:
• The assay fits into DNT testing batteries as a first-tier screening tool and confirmation assay.
• It is particularly strong in mechanistic assessment of neurite outgrowth impairment in CNS dopaminergic neurons.
• Its potential weaknesses are its focus on a single endpoint and the need for highly technical skills and equipment.
• Therefore, while it can be used as a stand-alone method for alert generation, additional complementary assays might be required to cover gaps in the assessment of overall neurotoxicity.

PMID: 34114044",Low,"The answer provides a list of publications related to the test method but does not address the specific requirement to indicate deviations from published descriptions. It also lacks detailed comments on the type of information each publication provides, such as test chemical lists or validation against other tests. The response is incomplete and does not fully address the question's requirements.","Below is an answer referring to the published literature and outlining in detail how our current procedure deviates from earlier published descriptions.

1. Deviations from Published Descriptions

• Prediction Model Parameters:  
 – The current version (V2.0) uses updated prediction model parameters compared to previous versions. This update (see section 2.3) changes the thresholds for hit‐identification (e.g. evaluating if neurite area decreases >20% rather than 50% under non‐cytotoxic conditions) compared to the initial settings described in earlier publications.  

• Plate and Coating Details:  
 – The method mandates coating of flasks and plates with a poly‐L-ornithine (PLO) and fibronectin solution (section 3.6). While earlier studies emphasized the coating procedure, our protocol notes that deviations in plastic ware from different suppliers can cause variations (section 3.5 and 6.5). For example, if alternative plastic plate suppliers are used, differences in the cell spreading and uniformity may arise.  

• Cell Number (Seeding Density):  
 – In our method, proliferating LUHMES cells are seeded on day –1 and, after two days of differentiation, are re‐plated onto 96‐well plates at 30,000 cells/well (section 4.1). This density is carefully optimized to yield approximately 60% confluency at treatment time. Previous descriptions sometimes used different seeding numbers (e.g. 40,000 cells/cm² during initial plating), so our approach represents an optimization to enhance reproducibility in neurite outgrowth measurements.

• Endpoint Measurement:  
 – Endpoint evaluation is performed by high-content imaging using the Cellomics Array Scan VTI, with simultaneous live staining for cell nuclei (Hoechst H-33342) and viable cells (calcein-AM). The neurite area is computed by subtracting a virtual cell soma area from the total calcein-positive footprint (section 5.3 and 5.4). Earlier publications sometimes relied on more manual or less standardized image analyses. Our current approach minimizes operator bias via machine learning-based cell identification and a fixed expansion width (3.2 µm) around nuclei.  

• Timing of Exposure and Readout:  
 – The test protocol defines a fixed schedule: cell seeding on day –1, medium change on day 0, re-plating and compound addition on day 2, and readout on day 3 (23.5 h after compound treatment), as detailed in sections 4.1 and 5.1. While the original studies also measured neurite outgrowth after differentiation, our current schedule ensures tighter control of development stage and compound exposure time, and any minor deviations (e.g. slight variation in attachment time) are noted as potential critical factors (section 6.5).

However, it lacks clarity on whether the test method specifically covers an AOP MIE/KE and does not reference the status of these AOPs in the AOP-wiki. The response is partially complete but lacks specific details and references required for a 'High' score.","The method has indeed been linked to several adverse outcome pathways. In its design the assay measures neurite outgrowth impairment—a recognized key event (KE) in neurotoxicity—which has been utilized to predict adverse outcomes such as parkinsonian motor deficits. In fact, the assay has been linked to AOP 3 (available on AOP-wiki), where inhibition of mitochondrial complex I leads to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and parkinsonian effects. In addition, the document indicates potential links to other AOPs (e.g. AOP 48, AOP 13, AOP 42, AOP 54, AOP 8, AOP 134) that relate to neurodegeneration, learning and memory impairments, or adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. 

It is important to note that while the assay is well suited to detect changes in a key event (impaired neurite outgrowth) downstream in the AOP, it does not directly assess the molecular initiating event (MIE); rather, it covers a KE from which the adverse outcome can be inferred.

"Indicate/summarize information on mechanistic validation, e.g. by omics approaches or by use of endpoint specific controls (MCC; section 5.5).

Reversibility and protection/counterregulation by mechanistic compounds have been shown (Stiegler 2011; Krug AK). d) The test covers a fundamental neurodevelopmental process. In some contexts, this might be seen as a key event of an AOP (Smirnova 2014, Bal-Price 2015 (ISTNET))",Medium,"The answer provides some relevant information about the mechanistic validation, such as the dopaminergic nature of LUHMES cells and their relevance to human biology. It mentions the role of tubulin and the Rho/Rock pathway in neurite outgrowth, and references studies showing reversibility and protection by mechanistic compounds. However, it lacks a comprehensive exploration of how well the system reflects human biology and specific tissue organization relevant to the toxicity form being assessed. The mention of a lack of formal mechanistic validation further limits the completeness of the response.","The assay’s mechanistic validation has been approached from two complementary angles. On one hand, specific endpoint control compounds (MCC) have been established to validate the modulation of neurite outgrowth. For example, narciclasine is used as a positive control for neurite inhibition (by activating the Rho pathway) and HA-1077 and Blebbistatine are used to demonstrate neurite growth enhancement and the key role of the Rho/ROCK pathway (Section 5.5, NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf).

On the other hand, extensive omics-based characterization has been performed. Transcriptome analyses, including a complete dataset on LUHMES differentiation from day 2 to 10, have confirmed the expression of critical neuronal markers and signaling components (e.g., dopaminergic markers such as tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine transporter DAT, and α-synuclein) and have further delineated pathways relevant for neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, epigenetic modifier profiles and specific gene signatures for AD and mitochondrial toxicants have been evaluated, strengthening the confidence that the test system reflects key aspects of human neuron biology and signaling (Sections 4.6 and 9.3, NeuriToxassay(UKN4).pdf).

Together, these approaches support that the system not only measures neurite outgrowth but also functionally recapitulates essential aspects of human dopaminergic neurons—such as neurotransmitter-related signaling and network formation—which are directly relevant for assessing neurotoxicity.

Programs used to conduct the analysis of the data (Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism) need to be purchased or obtained by license agreement, however data analysis and plotting can be done with other, freely available tools.",Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by stating that no elements of the test method are protected, but it lacks clarity and completeness. It mentions software that requires a license but does not specify the type of protection or where licenses can be obtained. It also does not address consumables, chemicals, analytical methods, or equipment in detail.","According to the provided document, none of the assay elements (consumables, chemicals, analytical methods, or equipment) are protected by patents or any other kind of intellectual property. In section 4.8 of the document, it is stated that the cells used in the test method “are not protected by patents or any other licences” and no additional patent or licensing restrictions are mentioned for other assay elements.
