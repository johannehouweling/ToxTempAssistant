Please describe in no more than 200 words the following:,,,,"The cMINC assay evaluates the impact of test compounds on the migration of human neural crest cells (NCCs). In this in vitro method, NCCs are derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells and characterized by markers such as HNK-1, p75, nestin, and AP2. Cells are seeded around silicone stoppers on coated wells to create a defined cell‑free circular area. When the stoppers are removed, cells adhere, proliferate mildly, and migrate into the gap. After a 24‑hour toxicant exposure, migration is quantified by high content imaging of cells stained with calcein‑AM and Hoechst‑33342. In parallel, cell viability outside the migration zone is assessed to ensure that reduced migration is not due to cytotoxicity. The assay employs endpoint‑specific controls (e.g., cytochalasin D, taxol, LiCl) and a defined prediction model for developmental toxicity, distinguishing specific migration inhibition from general cytotoxicity. This medium throughput method provides a reliable read‑out for predicting developmental disorders related to impaired NCC migration.

These pre-differentiated NCCs are seeded on coated wells where a silicone stopper creates a central, cell‐free area into which cells can migrate. 

The readouts include:  
– A specific endpoint that measures migration inhibition by quantifying the number of NCCs that have migrated into the cell‐free (central) area using high content imaging after staining with calcein‑AM and Hoechst‑33342.  
– A reference endpoint assessing cell viability, which is also quantified by detecting calcein‑AM/Hoechst double‐positive cells in fields outside the migration zone.

However, it lacks details on other aspects such as specifications for the material, functional parameters, stability over passages, valid passages, and exclusion criteria. It also does not address primary cells or genetically-modified cells and microphysiological systems.","The initial cells used in the assay (the hiPSC source) are accepted only if they meet several strict quality criteria. For example, the source hiPSC line (IMR90_clone_#4) must be free of pathogens (regular testing for mycoplasma is performed) and is characterized by its colony‐growth mode with a STR profile matching the reference (100% loci homology). To ensure that the cells have not undergone spontaneous differentiation, they are regularly checked by immunocytochemistry for the key pluripotency markers Oct4, Nanog, and Tra‑1‑60. In addition, only cells maintained up to 10 passages are considered valid for further differentiation. If cells exhibit any signs of differentiation or if cell density is incorrect (either too low or too high) leading to detachment or spontaneous differentiation, they are discarded. 

For the differentiated neural crest cells (NCCs), functional quality criteria include that >90% of the cells must be positive for the NCC markers HNK1 and p75 and they must not express markers that would indicate contamination with other cell types (for example, they must be negative for GFAP, Pax6, and βIII tubulin). Furthermore, upon thawing, cell viability must exceed 90%. For functional validation of the migration behavior, reference substances such as cytochalasin D or taxol are used as endpoint‐specific controls; these inhibit migration without affecting viability under defined conditions. 

Thus, in summary, the acceptance criteria are quantitatively defined as follows:
• Pathogen-free source cells confirmed via routine mycoplasma testing.
• hiPSC maintained as colonies on Laminin‑521 in E8 medium, with typical pluripotency confirmed by >90% expression of Oct4, Nanog, and Tra‑1‑60.
• Validity limited to cells maintained for up to 10 passages.
• Differentiated NCCs must be ≥90% positive for HNK1 and p75, exhibit >90% viability after thawing, and show no expression of non‑NCC markers such as GFAP, Pax6, or βIII tubulin.
• Exclusion criteria include any evidence of spontaneous differentiation, deviations from colony morphology, or low viability.
• Finally, functional performance is confirmed by applying known reference compounds that appropriately modulate cell migration (e.g. cytochalasin D).

Therefore splitting should be performed as fast as possible - Batch effects of critical additives (e.g. holo-transferrin for iron supply of cells or TGF-β which maintains cell pluripotency) can lead to differentiation of cells at low passage number.",Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by mentioning some causes of variability such as passage number, cell density, and batch effects of critical additives. However, it lacks detail on critical consumables, handling steps, and specific recommendations for genetically-modified cells and microphysiological systems. The response could be more comprehensive and specific to fully address the question.","The main contributors to variability of the initial/source cells are related to both the intrinsic cell quality and the handling/consumables used during maintenance and differentiation. For example, the document notes that:

• High passage numbers can negatively impact the performance of hiPSCs. Using cells beyond 10 passages increases the risk of altered behavior.  
• Inappropriate cell density is a critical issue; too low a density can result in poor attachment and differentiation problems, while too high a density may lead to detachment or unwanted spontaneous differentiation.  
• Batch‐to‐batch variability of critical additives is an important source of variability. For instance, additives such as holo‑transferrin (important for iron supply) or TGF‑β (which supports the maintenance of pluripotency) can vary between batches and lead to differentiation even at low passage numbers.  
• Handling factors play a major role. Cells should be maintained as colonies and not as single cells. Splitting must be performed rapidly to avoid prolonged exposure to suboptimal conditions, and extreme care must be taken during freeze–thaw procedures so that cells do not remain too long in 10% DMSO.  
• Although not explicitly detailed for plate format or serum replacement in the document, similar assays stress the importance of consistency in consumables (such as the specific suppliers of mats like Laminin‑521, PLO/laminin/fibronectin coatings) and pipetting accuracy (using multichannel pipettes with quick handling), which indirectly affect reproducibility.

In addition, when working with genetically modified cells or microphysiological systems, extra attention may be needed regarding matrix chemistry and geometry, microfluidics controls, and proper separation of surface versus core cells. While the provided context does not detail these aspects specifically for this assay, it is typically recommended to standardize these conditions as much as possible.

Recommendations for ensuring reproducibility and performance include:  
– Consistently use cells within a defined passage number range (preferably below 10 passages).  
– Strictly control cell seeding densities to maintain the recommended confluency (~80–100%).  
– Monitor batches of critical additives (e.g. holo‑transferrin, TGF‑β) and use validated lots to minimize variability.  
– Execute cell handling steps (such as splitting, seeding, and thawing) rapidly and uniformly, with special care using calibrated multichannel pipettes.  
– For genetically modified or microphysiological systems, rigorously define and standardize matrix properties, fluid dynamics, and cell distribution parameters.

After one day cells reached a confluency of 80-100% and differentiation was initiated (day 0’) by a medium change to KSR medium (Knock out DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium), 15% knock out serum replacement, 1% GlutaMax, 1% MEM NEAA (minimum essential medium - non-essential amino acids) solution, 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 20 ng/ml Noggin and 10 µM SB431542. From day 2 on cells were treated with 3 µM CHIR99021. Noggin and SB431542 were withdrawn at day 3 and 4, respectively. Beginning at day 4, the KSR medium was gradually replaced with N2-S medium (DMEM/F12 (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Ham's F-12), 1.55 mg/ml glucose, 1% GlutaMax, 0.1 mg/ml apotransferin, 25 µg/ml insulin, 20 nM progesterone, 100 μM putrescine, 30 nM selenium) in 25% increments. Cells were collected at day 11, resuspended in N2-S medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF (epidermal growth factor) and 20 ng/ml FGF2 (fibroblast growth factor 2) and seeded as droplets (10 µl) on poly-L-ornithine (PLO)/Laminin/Fibronectin coated 10 cm dishes. Cells were expanded by weekly splitting. From now on seeding as droplets was not necessary and medium was changed every second day. After 35-39 days, cells were cryopreserved at a concentration of 4*106 cells/ml in 90% N2-S medium and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Merck Millipore) until further use.",Medium,"The answer provides a detailed description of the differentiation protocol, including media, substrates, and manipulation steps. However, it lacks a graphical overview and does not address special/additional requirements for microphysiological systems and organoids, such as cell printing or interaction with the matrix. The absence of a scheme or graphical representation limits the completeness of the response.","The differentiation protocol follows a multi‐phase process that is graphically summarized in Figure 2 of the document. In brief, the protocol is initiated by plating human iPSCs on Matrigel‐coated 6‐well plates. The cells are seeded at a density of 100,000 cells/cm² in E8 medium supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (Y‐27632) to enhance survival. Once the cells reach 80–100% confluency after one day, differentiation is induced by replacing E8 with KSR medium (Knockout DMEM supplemented with 15% Knockout Serum Replacement, 1% GlutaMax, 1% MEM Non‐essential Amino Acids, and 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol) to which 20 ng/ml Noggin and 10 µM SB431542 are added. 

On day 2 of differentiation, 3 µM CHIR99021 is introduced to further direct differentiation toward the neural crest lineage, and subsequently the factors Noggin and SB431542 are withdrawn on days 3 and 4, respectively. Starting on day 4, the KSR medium is gradually replaced by N2-S medium—in 25% increments—to provide the cells with the appropriate environment for further maturation. The neural crest cells are collected on day 11, then re-suspended in N2-S medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF and 20 ng/ml FGF2 and seeded as 10 µl droplets onto 10 cm dishes coated with poly-L-ornithine, Laminin, and Fibronectin. This re-plating step helps to generate a more homogeneous cell population that can be expanded through weekly splitting until cryopreservation at approximately 35–39 days.

In this protocol, all medium changes, additions (e.g., Noggin, SB431542, CHIR99021, EGF, FGF2), substrate preparations (Matrigel for the initial plating; poly-L-ornithine/Laminin/Fibronectin for the later droplet seeding), and re-plating steps are precisely defined. Although the document does not specifically address additional requirements associated with microphysiological systems or organoids (such as cell printing, self-aggregation, or geometrical characterization), the described differentiation process emphasizes controlled plating and re-plating steps and well-defined substrate conditions to ensure homogeneous colony formation and cell behavior.

Additional details from the document include:

1. Cells are propagated as undifferentiated hiPSCs (IMR90_clone_#4) maintained on a Laminin‑521–coated surface in Essential 8 (E8) medium. They grow in colonies and are “split weakly” to preserve colony integrity. Regular propagation is performed by thawing a new working stock after a maximum of 10 passages.  
 _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

2. The purity and identity of the cells are monitored by testing for pluripotency markers. Although an explicit numerical purity (e.g. “95% Oct4‑positive”) is not provided, the maintenance protocol states that cells are routinely checked for the expression of Oct4, Nanog, and Tra‑1‑60 by immunocytochemistry and that the STR signature confirms 100% loci homology.  
 _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

3. Quality control measures include:
 • Regular testing to ensure the cell population is pathogen‑free (e.g. mycoplasma testing).  
 • Routine immunocytochemical verification of pluripotency markers (Oct4, Nanog, Tra‑1‑60).  
 • Genetic identity confirmed by STR analysis.  
 For each batch, the acceptance criteria are that the cells must be pathogen‑free, maintain colony morphology, express the appropriate pluripotency markers, and be kept at a maximum of 10 passages before replacing with a new vial from the working stock.  
 _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

4. In terms of regulatory practice, while the document does not state explicitly “GCCP” or “GIVIMP,” the procedure follows well‐established quality standards (including documentation, SOP use, and internal protocols) as expected in a laboratory setting.  
 _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

5. Frozen stocks and cell banks are prepared from the master stock purchased from WiCell. Working stocks are generated by thawing the master stock and, after propagation, cells are stored under defined conditions. For example, differentiated neural crest cells (the end product of the protocol) are cryopreserved at 4×10^6 cells/mL in a medium composed of 90% N2‑S medium and 10% DMSO. Although this last detail refers specifically to the differentiated cells, the precautions (such as fast handling during freeze‑thaw and the use of aliquots to avoid repeated freezing and thawing) are similarly applied during iPSC propagation.

Thus, in summary, the general maintenance SOP is provided via the database link above and includes clear procedures for cell propagation, quality control (including purity confirmation and pathogen testing), passage limits (up to 10 passages), and frozen stock preparation—all conducted under standard quality practices expected in a well‐managed cell culture laboratory.",0.3484675719343692,-0.03166541829705238,-0.544511616230011,-0.3664983808994293
"Describe the test system as it is used in the test. If the generation of the test system involves differentiation steps or complex technical manipulation (e.g. formation of microtissues), this is described in 3.6. Give details on the general features/principles of the culture protocol (collagen embedding, 3D structuring, addition of mitotic inhibitors, addition of particular hormones/growth factors, etc.) of the cells that are used for the test. What is the percentage of contaminating cells; in co-cultures what is the percentage of each subpopulation? Are there subpopulations that are generally more sensitive to cytotoxicity than others, and could this influence viability measures? Is it known whether specific chemicals/chemical classes show differential cytotoxicity for the cell sub-populations used?","A highly homogeneous pre-differentiated population of neural crest cells is added to coated wells. In the middle of the well is a silicone stopper that prevents cells from settling in a circular area in the middle of the well. The cells are kept viable and alive by the presence of EGF and FGF in the medium, and they become adherent overnight. When the stopper is removed, the cells form a dense monolayer in the culture dish, with a sharply demarcated circular area in the middle that is free of cells. Due to their natural spontaneous migration behaviour, the cells move into the cell-free area. The cells are still in a proliferative state. Proliferation at the edge of the cell free area contributes to a small extent to “apparent migration behaviour”. This has been characterized and quantified in detail (Nyffeler et al. 2016). It is accounted for by counting cells in a narrower circle than the original circular area.",Medium,"The answer provides a detailed description of the test system, including the culture protocol and cell behavior. However, it lacks information on the percentage of contaminating cells, the percentage of each subpopulation in co-cultures, and whether specific chemicals show differential cytotoxicity for the cell sub-populations used. These omissions prevent a 'High' score.","The test system used in this assay comprises a highly homogeneous population of neural crest cells (NCCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). The generation of these NCCs involves a multi‐step differentiation protocol rather than complex three‐dimensional (3D) structuring or embedding into collagen. In brief, hiPSCs (IMR90_clone_#4) are maintained as colonies on Laminin‑521 in essential 8 medium and then induced to differentiate using a sequential media change. Initially, the cells are plated on Matrigel in the presence of a ROCK inhibitor, followed by a switch to KSR medium supplemented with Noggin and SB431542. Later, CHIR99021 is added, and the KSR medium is gradually replaced with N2‑S medium supplemented with EGF and FGF. The differentiated NCCs (collected around day 11 and expanded on poly‑L‑ornithine/Laminin/Fibronectin coated dishes) form a dense monolayer and are subsequently used in the assay by seeding them around silicone stoppers that create a cell‑free circular area. Removing the stoppers allows the cells to migrate into the central zone.  
_(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

Regarding culture specifics, no additional complex technical manipulations (e.g. collagen embedding, creation of microtissues, or use of mitotic inhibitors) are applied. The protocol relies on growth factor supplementation (EGF and FGF) to maintain cell viability and support the limited proliferation inherent under these conditions. In this protocol, the differentiated NCCs are reported to be ≥90% positive for NCC markers (HNK‑1 and p75), implying that contaminating cell types represent less than 10% of the culture. There is no further subdivision of the cell population provided—no specific details are mentioned about percentages of subpopulations in co‑cultures, nor is there any statement about certain subpopulations being more sensitive to cytotoxicity. In addition, the documentation does not indicate that specific chemicals or chemical classes differentially affect subpopulations within the NCCs in terms of cytotoxicity, thus suggesting that the viability measures are considered for the cell population as a whole.

However, it lacks detailed acceptance criteria, specific analytical methods, and historical control data. It also does not specify actions if acceptance criteria are not met.","The quality of the NCC culture is mainly controlled by verifying both cell identity and viability before starting the toxicity testing. For example, once the hiPSCs have been fully differentiated into neural crest cells (NCCs), we confirm that the cells display the typical NCC profile by using the following endpoints and methods (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf):

• Marker expression: The newly differentiated NCCs must be ≥90% positive for the neural crest markers HNK-1 and p75. In addition, cells are also assessed for the expression of AP2 and the stem cell microfilament protein nestin by immunofluorescence, while markers for astrocytes (GFAP), central nervous system precursors (Pax6) and neurons (βIII tubulin) should not be expressed.

• Viability: After thawing, cell viability is directly measured and must be above 90%.

• Morphology: The cells should show the expected mesenchymal-like morphology and collective migration behavior, which can be confirmed by imaging (e.g., double staining for nestin and f-actin).

• Additional controls: Prior to performing the migration assay, immunocytochemistry and FACS analyses are used to verify proper marker expression in the cell culture. Furthermore, the cells are regularly tested to be pathogen (e.g., mycoplasma) free.

Historical performance of the test system confirms that during repeated differentiations the NCC cultures reliably show ≥90% marker expression and >90% viability. If the cultures deviate from the acceptance criteria (for example, if viability falls below 90%, or the percentage of cells positive for HNK-1 or p75 is less than 90%), the batch is discarded or the differentiation process is repeated to ensure robust and reproducible results.

In summary, the combined analytical endpoints of immunocytochemistry, FACS analysis, high content imaging, and viability assays guarantee that only cultures meeting these quality criteria (marker expression ≥90%, viability >90%, correct morphology, and pathogen-free status) enter the toxicity testing phase.

It provides minimal information about acceptance criteria, focusing only on cell migration and viability, without discussing endpoints, parameters, historical controls, or actions if criteria are not met. It lacks detail and completeness required to fully address the question.","The assay requires that both the source cells (undifferentiated hiPSCs) and the derived NCCs meet several quality criteria before they can be used for migration testing.

1. For the hiPSC source material it is essential that:
 • The cells are pathogen‐free (regular mycoplasma testing).
 • Their pluripotency is confirmed by regular expression of markers such as Oct4, Nanog, and Tra‑1‑60.
 • The cells are plated at an appropriate density (confluency of 80–100% at the start of differentiation) so that neither too low (risk of detachment) nor too high cell density (increased spontaneous differentiation) occurs.  
_(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

2. For the differentiated neural crest cells (NCCs):
 • They must exhibit a defined differentiation profile by being ≥90% positive for NCC markers (HNK‑1 and p75) and by expressing markers such as nestin and AP2, while showing an absence of markers like GFAP, Pax6, and βIII tubulin.
 • Immediately after thawing, the cells should show >90% viability.  
_(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

3. For the test system at the end of compound exposure:
 • Negative control wells must show that cells have migrated into the cell‐free area.
 • Cell viability in these control wells must be >90%.
 • Additionally, if the negative control results in a decrease in migration of ≥10% relative to solvent controls, the experiment is discarded.
 • Similarly, if the positive control (e.g., cytochalasin D) does not reduce migration (i.e. if cell numbers in the migration zone are ≥75% of control), the test is also discarded.
_(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

4. Historical control data indicate that for untreated conditions:
 • Intra-experimental variation in migration is typically 14.8 ± 4.3% and cell viability varies around 6 ± 3%.
 • Inter-experimental variation is on the order of 15.6% for migration and 9.7% for viability.
 • Positive controls show an average migration reduction (e.g. to around 40% of control) with considerable inter-experimental variation.
If experiments fall outside these historical ranges (for example, if the migration in negative controls is much lower or the variability is too high), the respective runs are not accepted.
_(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

5. Actions if the acceptance criteria are not met include:
 • Discarding the experiment if undifferentiated cells or NCCs do not meet the quality marker thresholds (e.g., <90% HNK‑1/p75 positivity or viability below 90%).
 • Aborting the assay if the migration in negative controls is decreased by ≥10% or if the positive control does not reach the expected inhibition (migration ≥75% of control), thereby ensuring that each test run is only accepted when the quality criteria hold.

This can decrease number of viable cells after thawing.,Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by mentioning some causes of variability such as high passage number, cell density, and handling during freeze and thaw processes. However, it lacks details on critical consumables, batch effects, specific handling steps, controls, expected values, and recommendations for reproducibility and performance.","Below is a summary of the known variability factors, critical consumables, handling steps, control expectations and recommendations for reproducibility as described in the document:

1. Known causes of variability and influencing factors:
 • Source cell properties: High passage number of hiPSCs can alter NCC differentiation. Too low or too high seeding density may result in cell detachment or unwanted spontaneous differentiation. Cells must be maintained as colonies and are sensitive to both under‑ and over‑population. (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Variability and troubleshooting of source cells”)

 • Batch effects of critical additives: Batch-to-batch differences of key additives – for example, holo‑transferrin (iron supply) and TGF‑β (which helps maintain pluripotency) – can influence the differentiation status of the hiPSC and, subsequently, NCC performance. Differences in serum replacement (KSR) batches may also impact the differentiation process. (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Variability and troubleshooting of source cells”)

 • Plate format and consumables: Use of coated 96‑well plates (inner 60 wells only to avoid edge effects) and silicone stoppers requires consistency, as variations in coating (PLO/laminin/fibronectin) or differences between suppliers may contribute to variability. (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Handling details of the test method” and “Uncertainties and troubleshooting”)

2. Critical handling steps and influencing factors:
 • Pipetting: Special care is needed when adding compounds. Tips should touch the well wall just above the medium surface so that the droplet flows in rather than sticking. Consistent use of multichannel and multistepper pipettes minimizes pipetting errors. (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Handling details of the test method” and “Uncertainties and troubleshooting”)
 • Rapid processing: During freeze–thaw procedures and medium exchange, cells must be handled quickly. Prolonged exposure to 10% DMSO or delays during medium change can reduce cell viability. (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Variability of the test system and troubleshooting”)
 • Cell density and timing: Optimal confluency at differentiation start (80–100% on day 0) and rapid removal of the silicone stopper on Day 0 are critical to establishing the cell‑free migration zone. (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Differentiation towards the final test system” and “Test method exposure scheme”)

3. Positive and negative controls, expected values and accepted deviations:
 • Positive controls: Typical controls include cytochalasin D (200 nM), LiCl (10 mM), and taxol (10 nM). A positive control is expected to significantly inhibit migration (e.g. migration percentage substantially below the untreated control, with the expectation that failure is defined by a migration cell count in the ROI that is ≥75% of the control). (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Endpoint-specific controls / mechanistic control compounds” and “Acceptance criteria for the test method”)
 • Negative controls: Solvent controls (0.1% DMSO, paracetamol, etc.) are used. Under negative control conditions migration should proceed normally and the cell viability must remain above 90%. A test is discarded if the negative control reduces migration by ≥10%. (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Acceptance criteria for the test method”)
 • Variability estimates: Intra‑experimental (baseline) variation is about 14.8 ± 4.3% for migration and 6 ± 3% for cell viability; inter‑experimental variation is approximately 15.6% for migration and 9.7% for viability. Positive control variability has been noted to be around 32.2% inter‑experimentally. (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Variation and test performance”)

4. Recommendations to ensure reproducibility and performance:
 • Maintain consistency in cell culture: Use working stocks with controlled passage numbers (ideally not exceeding 10 passages) and monitor confluency closely.
 • Quality control of critical additives: Verify batch-to-batch consistency for additives like holo‑transferrin, TGF‑β, and KSR to minimize differentiation drift.
 • Standardize lab procedures and pipetting: Adopt automated or semi‑automated pipetting (multichannel pipettes, multistepper pipettes) and ensure operators are well trained (typically within 2–4 weeks of handling) to minimize technical errors.
 • Use consistent plate formats and prevent edge effects by limiting use to inner wells and pre‑filling edge wells with PBS.
 • Document plate maps, handling protocols, and any pipetting errors immediately, and utilize automated image analysis software for migration and viability quantification.
 • Adhere strictly to time‑sensitive steps (especially during compound addition and medium changes) to preserve cell viability and performance. (Sources: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Variability and troubleshooting”, “Handling details of the test method”, and “Uncertainties and troubleshooting”)

Give information on where the test system differs from the mimicked human tissue and which gaps of analogy need to be considered.,- The cells are able to migrate mostly as single cells; they show some evidence of collective migration - Cells show invasive behaviour in a 3D environment (e.g. transwell assay),Low,The answer does not address the question about differences between the test system and mimicked human tissue or the gaps of analogy. It only describes cell behavior without comparing it to human tissue.,"The test system recapitulates key aspects of neural crest cell (NCC) migration, yet it does not fully mimic the in vivo tissue. For example, the system uses a homogeneous, pre‐differentiated population of NCCs placed in a defined two‑dimensional geometry (a cell‐free circular area created by a stopper) to trigger migration. In contrast, in vivo NCC migration occurs within a complex three‑dimensional environment with dynamic extracellular matrix composition, gradients of signaling molecules, and interactions with other cell types. Additionally, while the assay design accounts in part for proliferation (which can minimally influence migration), actual fetal tissue involves a broader set of cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions that are not captured in the assay.

Below is a summary of the key maintenance aspects addressed in that SOP:

• Basic cell propagation:  
 – Undifferentiated hiPSC (IMR90_clone_#4) are maintained as a monoculture on Laminin‑521 in Essential 8 (E8) medium. Cells grow as colonies and are split gently (to avoid single cell dispersion) so that their self‑renewal and pluripotency (regularly confirmed by immunocytochemistry for markers such as Oct4, Nanog and Tra‑1‑60) are preserved.  
  (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)

• Purity of the cell population:  
 – The culture is routinely checked; the cells are expected to be highly pure (>90%). Although a specific percentage like “95% Oct4‑positive” is not explicitly stated, regular marker testing ensures maintenance of pluripotency.  
  (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)

• Quality control measures and acceptance criteria per cell batch:  
 – Cells are monitored for pathogen‐freedom (e.g., mycoplasma testing) and for stable expression of pluripotency markers via immunocytochemistry.  
 – A working stock is only used while showing colony morphology with >90% viability upon thawing and sufficient pluripotency marker expression.  
  (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)

• Passage numbers used in the test:  
 – The cells are maintained in culture for up to 10 passages before a new vial from the working stock is thawed.  
  (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)

• Adherence to good practice:  
 – The SOP reflects adherence to Good Cell Culture Practice (GCCP). Although Good In Vitro Method Practice (GIVIMP) is not explicitly referenced, the procedures described are in line with standard in‑vitro and cell culture quality standards.  
  (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)

• Duration of use for a cell batch:  
 – The same working cell stocks may be used up to 10 passages. After that, a new vial from the master/working stock is thawed to ensure optimal performance.  
  (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)

• Preparation of freezing stocks and cell banks:  
 – Initially, a masterstock is prepared by freezing cells soon after purchase. Multiple working stocks are derived from this masterstock and maintained by regular thawing. In addition, for differentiated cells, after ~35–39 days of NCC expansion, cells are cryopreserved at 4×10⁶ cells/ml in 90% N2‑S medium with 10% DMSO.

• Note on primary cells:  
 – This assay uses an iPSC line rather than primary cells. For primary cells, one would typically describe the isolation procedure from donor tissue with criteria based on donor health status and specific marker expression; however, that is not applicable here.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
Timeline Overview

Day –1 (Preparation and Seeding):  
• Coat the 96‐well plate with a mixture of poly-L-ornithine (PLO), laminin, and fibronectin.  
• Place silicone stoppers centrally into each well.  
• Seed pre-differentiated human neural crest cells (NCCs) (obtained from thawed, cryopreserved sources and cultured as droplets prior to seeding) around the stoppers.  
• Allow cells to attach overnight.  
           [Cells are freshly re-plated and attached on a coated surface]

Day 0 (Start of Exposure):  
• Remove the silicone stoppers to reveal a defined, cell-free (circular) area in the center of each well.  
• Replace the existing medium with pre-warmed, fresh N2-S medium that is supplemented with critical growth factors – Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) – which are required to support viability and migration.  
• Allow the cells to settle and start migrating into the cell-free area.  
           [No re-plating is needed; the cells are intact from the previous day]

Day 1 (Compound Addition and Incubation):  
• Add 25 µl of a 5x concentrated toxicant (compound) dilution directly to each well (thus achieving the working concentration with a final DMSO concentration of 0.1%).  
• Continue incubation for 24 hours.  
• Note: No additional medium change or re-addition of compounds occurs; the compounds remain in the medium throughout the exposure period.

Day 2 (Sampling and Endpoint Assessment):  
• After the 24-hour compound exposure, stain the cells with calcein-AM and Hoechst 33342 for 30 minutes at 37 °C.  
• Image the wells using a high content imaging microscope to quantify both migration (in the previously cell-free zone) and cell viability.  
           [No further medium supplementation is needed at this step]

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
Additional Notes in the Overall Scheme

• The test system uses pre-differentiated NCCs that are seeded as a confluent monolayer around a central non-adherent (stopped) area.  
• Critical medium supplements (EGF and FGF in the N2-S medium) are added on Day 0 to ensure cell viability and support the migratory behavior required for the assay.  
• There is a single medium change on Day 0 when the stoppers are removed; compounds are only added on Day 1 without subsequent medium renewal.  
• The timeline ensures that the cells remain attached and viable across the full assay duration so that migration into the central cell-free area can be properly quantified at the end of the exposure period.  

This graphical timeline and step-by-step description reflect the protocol as detailed under the ""Exposure scheme for toxicity testing"" section (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf).",0.8004443204021051,0.3116457462310791,-0.09877646714448929,0.0744461938738823
"Define the specific endpoint(s) of the test system that you use for toxicity testing (e.g. cytotoxicity, cell migration, etc.). Indicate whether cytotoxicity is the primary endpoint. What are secondary/further endpoints? Also describe here potential reference/normalization endpoints (e.g. cytotoxicity, protein content, housekeeping gene expression) that are used for normalization of the primary endpoint.","Specific Endpoint: Migration inhibition Reference endpoint: Cell viability Note: Migration induction is also possible to assess, but complex in its toxicological interpretation. Therefore only unidirectional migration is assessed as an endpoint if the method is used in a standardized testing procedure in the prediction model.",Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by identifying migration inhibition as a specific endpoint and cell viability as a reference endpoint. However, it lacks clarity and completeness as it does not explicitly state whether cytotoxicity is the primary endpoint, nor does it mention any secondary endpoints or further reference/normalization endpoints beyond cell viability.","The primary endpoint of the assay is the inhibition of neural crest cell (NCC) migration. This is quantified by measuring the number of cells that migrate into the previously cell‐free circular area after the stopper is removed. In parallel, cell viability is measured in the same assay as a reference (or normalization) endpoint. The viability is determined by quantifying cells that are double‐positive for calcein‐AM and Hoechst 33342 staining, ensuring that a reduction in migration is not simply due to cytotoxicity. 

Thus, cytotoxicity (as measured by cell viability) is not the primary endpoint; instead, it serves as the normalization reference to help interpret migration changes. While migration is the specific endpoint for toxicity testing, additional secondary endpoints may include further measures of cell viability and proliferation (for example, potential EdU staining for proliferation) and other biochemical assays (e.g., resazurin conversion, extracellular LDH release, or ATP content) that can also serve as normalization or confirmation endpoints.

The number of migrated cells into the cell free zone is quantified 24 h after toxicant treatment. Migration inhibition of NCCs after treatment with toxicants is measured relative to control conditions (solvent control cells). For the quantification the cells are stained with calcein-AM and H-33342 for 30 min at 37 °C. The center of the well (migration zone) is imaged in four tiles with a 5x objective. Afterwards the four images are stitched together to obtain one image. For migration quantification, a software tool has been developed (http://invitrotox.uni-konstanz.de/). With the help of this software the previously cell-free area can be estimated and the number of H-33342 and calcein double-positive cells in the region of interest (ROI) can be counted. The diameter of the ROI was chosen so that 150 to 300 cells were in the ROI in untreated conditions. An Excel table containing the number of viable cells in the ROI of all wells of the plate is generated by the software. Cell viability: Cell viability is measured after 48 h outside the migration zone in the same well. The cells are stained with calcein-AM and H-33342 and four fields outside the migration zone are imaged with a 10x objective. Viability is defined as the number of H-33342 and calcein double-positive cells, viable cells are determined by an automated algorithm. An excel file is generated with the number of viable cells in each well. Migration and Viability are normalized to untreated controls.",High,"The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the analytical methods used, including the key steps involved in the migration inhibition and cell viability assays. It describes the plating and imaging process, the staining procedure, and the software used for quantification. The explanation includes how endpoints are measured, both in the same well and under different conditions, and details the imaging and quantification process. This level of detail is sufficient for reviewers to understand the methodology without being able to directly replicate it, which aligns well with the requirements of the question.","The assay uses live, pre‐differentiated human neural crest cells that migrate into a defined, cell-free zone. In brief, the cells are plated around a silicone stopper on a coated well so that a central circular area remains cell‑free. After overnight attachment, the stopper is removed and cells are allowed to migrate into this zone. Then, compounds are applied, and after a set exposure period (24 hours), the cells are stained (with calcein‑AM and Hoechst 33342) without any fixation step. This staining allows simultaneous quantification of two endpoints—migration (by counting cells that have entered the formerly cell‑free area) and cell viability (by counting viable, double‑positive cells in fields outside the migration zone)—both measured in the same well and under identical assay conditions.

For imaging, a high content imaging system (Cellomics ArrayScan II) collects images in two fluorescence channels. The migration endpoint is quantified by stitching together images of the central zone and using dedicated software (the Ringassay tool) to calculate the previously cell‑free area and determine the number of viable cells (typically resulting in counts of 150–300 cells per region of interest in untreated conditions). Similarly, viability is assessed by imaging several fields (four fields with a 10× objective outside the migration zone) and automatically counting double‑positive cells using an image analysis algorithm optimized to identify nuclei based on size, shape, and fluorescence intensity.

Four fields per well were imaged.

1. Machine Settings and Imaging Conditions  
• An automated microplate reading microscope (Array‑ScanII HCS Reader, Cellomics, PA) is used equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA‑ER camera (1024 × 1024 pixels with 2 × 2 binning).  
• For migration imaging, four fields per well are recorded with a 5× objective. Two channels are used with the following settings:  
 – Channel 1: excitation/emission at 365 ± 50/535 ± 45 nm to detect H‑33342 (nuclear stain)  
 – Channel 2: excitation/emission at 474 ± 40/535 ± 45 nm to detect calcein‑AM (cytoplasmic live cell stain)  
• For cell viability imaging, four fields outside the migration zone are recorded with a 10× objective.  
_(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, sections “Quantification of migration” and “Quantification of individual viable cells by imaging”)_

2. Analytical Standards and Controls  
• Endpoint‐specific controls include positive controls for migration inhibition such as cytochalasin D (200 nM), LiCl (10 mM) and taxol (10 nM). Negative controls include the solvent control (0.1% DMSO) along with other unspecific toxicants.  
• These controls are used to set acceptance criteria wherein the positive control must reduce migration sufficiently (i.e. migrated cell number <75% of control) and the negative control must not decrease migration by more than 10%.  
_(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, sections “Endpoint(s) of the test method” and “Endpoint-specific controls / mechanistic control compounds (MCC)”)_

3. Data Processing and Normalization Procedures  
• Imaging data from the Array Scan are exported (as, for example, 8‑bit tiff files) and imported into a dedicated software tool (http://invitrotox.uni‑konstanz.de/) for migration quantification.  
• The software estimates the cell‑free (migration) area and counts the number of double‑positive cells (both H‑33342 and calcein‑AM positive) within a predefined circular Region of Interest (ROI) that is set so that 150 to 300 cells are counted in untreated control conditions. The software generates an Excel table with counts per well.  
• For viability, the same wells are analyzed using the ArrayScan VTI 700 Series software. Nuclei in channel 1 are segmented by size, shape, area, and intensity; apoptotic cells (with increased fluorescence) are excluded, and viable cells are defined as those that are both H‑33342 and calcein‑AM positive.  
• Data for both migration and viability endpoints are compiled in Excel and subsequently analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Both endpoints are normalized relative to untreated (solvent) controls.  
• Curve fitting is performed by nonlinear regression (4‑parameter log function), and if this fails, a linear fit is used.

4. Detailed Algorithm for Imaging Endpoints  
• For Migration:  
 – The instrument acquires four tile images per well. These images are stitched together to form a complete view of the central migration zone (initially cell‑free due to the silicone stopper).  
 – The custom “Ringassay” software then estimates the boundaries of the cell‑free zone and defines a circular ROI with a diameter selected to yield 150–300 cells in untreated conditions.  
 – Within this ROI, the algorithm automatically counts only those cells that are double‑positive for H‑33342 and calcein‑AM, thereby quantifying migrated, viable cells.  
 – The output is compiled as an Excel table listing viable cell numbers per well.  
• For Cell Viability:  
 – Four additional fields (outside the migration zone) are imaged using a 10× objective.  
 – The ArrayScan VTI 700 Series software analyzes these images by segmenting nuclei based on preset criteria (size, intensity, shape) in channel 1 while confirming calcein‑AM signal in channel 2.  
 – Apoptotic nuclei (identified by abnormally high fluorescence) are excluded, and only double‑positive signals are considered viable cells.  
 – Viability data are then exported to Excel for normalization to untreated controls.

However, it does not list up to 10 controls, lacks a description of expected data, does not highlight compounds for setting acceptance criteria, and does not address whether pathway inhibitions or activations correlate with the test method response.","Based on the cMINC protocol, the following MCC are described as showing biologically plausible alterations in neural crest cell (NCC) migration:

1. Cytochalasin D (200 nM)  
 • MCC Reasoning: It specifically disrupts actin polymerization, a process essential for NCC migration.  
 • Expected Data: A marked decrease in the number of migrated cells (typically migration reduced to <75% of the DMSO control) while cell viability remains ≥90%.  
 • Role in AC: It is used as a day‐to‐day positive control for setting acceptance criteria.  
 • Pathway Effect: Inhibition of actin dynamics correlates directly with a lower migration endpoint.  
  (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)

2. Taxol (10 nM)  
 • MCC Reasoning: It stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their dynamic breakdown, which is required for cell movement.  
 • Expected Data: Similar to cytochalasin D, it produces a decrease in migration with minimally impacted viability.  
 • Role in AC: Also used for real‐time monitoring of assay performance.  
 • Pathway Effect: Microtubule pathway inhibition leads to reduced migration, matching the assay’s response.  
  (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)

3. Lithium chloride (LiCl, 10 mM)  
 • MCC Reasoning: Though its comprehensive mechanism in this test system is not as elaborated as the cytoskeletal modulators, LiCl is included among the positive controls based on its consistent ability to reduce migration.  
 • Expected Data: A reproducible inhibition of migration, again with viability maintained at levels ≥90%.  
 • Role in AC: Employed as an established positive control.  
 • Pathway Effect: The migration inhibition observed correlates with a modulation of pathways that impact cytoskeletal dynamics, even if indirectly.  
  (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)

Additional compounds are mentioned in the document as endpoint‐specific controls, although some are considered unspecific toxicants rather than MCC per se. These include:  
4. Cytarabine (AraC) – known to inhibit proliferation, which can indirectly affect apparent migration.  
5. Aphidicolin – a DNA synthesis inhibitor that affects cell cycle, thereby having downstream consequences on migration.  
6. L‐homocysteine – reported as an endpoint‐specific control with measurable effects on migration.  
7. MG‑132 – a proteasome inhibitor that can impact cell signaling and migration.  
8. Staurosporine – a broad spectrum kinase inhibitor known to alter cell migration by modulating several signaling cascades.  
9. Triton X‑100 – though it affects cell integrity and viability, its use is more for assessing unspecific toxicity rather than a specific mechanistic participation in migration.  
10. Paracetamol – used as a negative control, expected to show no significant interference with NCC migration.  

For day‐to‐day test performance and acceptance criteria, the protocol specifically highlights Cytochalasin D, Taxol, and LiCl as positive controls. In these cases, direct pathway inhibition (i.e. actin polymerization and microtubule dynamics) correlates with the observed decrease in the migration endpoint. No activators of migration are specifically provided in the context; rather, the assay focuses on an inhibition readout. Thus, when the pathways crucial for migration are inhibited by these MCC, the test method response shows decreased migration as expected, while any increase in migration (e.g., by an activator) would likely be more complex to interpret toxicologically.  

Overall, the inhibition of specific cytoskeletal pathways by these MCC correlates well with the decrease in migrated cell numbers observed in the assay.

Are in vivo relevant threshold concentrations known?,"Positive control: Cytochalasin D (200 nM), LiCl (10 mM), taxol (10 nM)",Low,"The answer lists chemicals used as positive controls but does not describe the expected data on these controls, such as signal and its uncertainty. It also does not address the quality of in vivo reference data or whether in vivo relevant threshold concentrations are known.","Positive controls in the assay are chemicals known to inhibit cell migration without causing overt cytotoxicity. In this assay the positive controls used are cytochalasin D (200 nM), LiCl (10 mM), and taxol (10 nM) (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, page 168).

Regarding the expected data, a properly functioning positive control should strongly reduce the number of migrated cells. In practice, a test is rejected if the positive control does not reduce migration to below 75% of the solvent control. In earlier evaluations using cytochalasin D, the migration percentage relative to control typically ranged between about 30% and 70% across plates. In one example, a positive control that on average reduced migration to about 40% was noted, with an inter-experimental variability such that the control value could fluctuate approximately ±20% (i.e. from around 20% to 60% of control) (Sources: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, pages 168 and 177).

In terms of in vivo reference data on these positive controls, the documentation does not provide well‐defined in vivo thresholds specifically for these compounds. Although there is some discussion of in vitro–in vivo extrapolation in general (with in vivo plasma concentrations of certain test compounds falling in the same range as the in vitro concentrations used in related assays), no detailed in vivo reference data or clearly established in vivo threshold concentrations for the positive controls are available (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, pages 174–175).",0.7020968530668358,0.5553712844848633,-0.2076939195394516,0.060737937688827515

It lacks completeness and clarity in addressing the question.","The assay uses a solvent control containing 0.1% DMSO as the primary negative control. In addition, paracetamol and ASS (acetylsalicylic acid) are mentioned as negative/unspecific controls. Under negative control conditions the cells are expected to migrate into the cell‐free area (i.e. nearly full migration similar to untreated conditions) and show a viability of >90%. In practice, the untreated (solvent‐control) migration reaches a level where approximately 150–300 cells are counted in the region of interest (ROI) and the assay’s baseline variations have been quantified to be around 15% for migration (inter‑experimental variation about 15.6%, intra‑experimental around 14.8 ± 4.3%) and 6–10% for viability. These data define the background “noise” of the assay.

The 0.1% DMSO concentration is chosen because it matches the final solvent concentration present in all test wells after compound dilution. This means that any effects observed are attributable to the active compounds rather than differences in vehicle conditions.

Furthermore, unspecific controls (i.e. compounds not expected to specifically affect neural crest cell migration) are also employed. Paracetamol and ASS are used because, based on their known profiles, they do not impair cell migration or viability at the concentrations applied—thus serving to confirm that non-specific effects are not confounding the assay readout.

It only mentions cell proliferation and mitosis, which are not directly relevant to the questions asked.","Based on the cMINC assay documentation:

• Apoptosis sensitivity/resistance: The assay is performed using a highly homogeneous population of neural crest cells (≥90% positive for NCC markers) and does not provide any specific information on whether these cells have a particular sensitivity or resistance to apoptosis. No details are given on differences in how apoptotic processes might affect minor subpopulations because the system is not designed to resolve heterogeneous populations. (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)

• Cytotoxicity in minor subpopulations and sensitivity in multicellular systems: Because the test system consists of nearly uniform neural crest cells, there is no discussion of capturing cytotoxicity within minor cellular subpopulations or identifying a specific subpopulation as being more sensitive. No separate markers for distinct cell populations or specific sensitivity hierarchies are reported. (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)

• Distinguishing slowed proliferation from cell death: The documentation notes that about 30% of the cells undergo mitosis during the assay and that proliferation can interfere with the migration readout. Although this indicates that slowed proliferation versus cell loss could be a complicating factor, the assay primarily determines cell viability by measuring calcein‐AM and Hoechst double-positive cells. There is an acknowledgment that proliferation effects (for example, in the context of AraC addition) might confound interpretation, but no detailed strategy is provided to unequivocally distinguish slowed proliferation from actual cell death. (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)

• Repeated/prolonged dosing and delayed cytotoxicity: The protocol does not address whether early cell death followed by compensatory growth is taken into account in repeated/prolonged dosing scenarios. In addition, for very short‐term endpoints—for instance, when assessing electrophysiological parameters 30 minutes after toxicant exposure—there is no mention of a delayed measure of cytotoxicity being provided.

Which rule do you apply to test whether a test run is within the normal performance frame? How do you document this decision? Indicate actions if the AC are not met.,"A test is discarded if the positive control did not inhibit migration, e.g. if the cell number in the migration zone is ≥ 75% of control. If the negative control decreases migration ≥ 10%, the test is discarded.",Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by specifying rules for discarding a test based on control performance. However, it lacks clarity on how the decision is documented and does not explicitly indicate actions if acceptance criteria (AC) are not met beyond discarding the test.","The decision is based on the assay’s predefined acceptance criteria (AC) that serve as the quality-control rules for a valid test run. Specifically, the run is considered within the normal performance frame if:

1. The negative control shows proper migration into the cell‑free area and cell viability remains >90%.  
2. The positive controls perform as expected, meaning they inhibit migration so that the cell number in the migration zone is less than 75% of the solvent control.

These criteria are applied by comparing the migration and viability data from every run against these set benchmarks. The outcome – whether the run meets criteria or is out‐of‐specification – is documented consistently. This is done by recording the data in an Excel file (generated by the imaging analysis software) and noted on the plate maps and in the experiment’s lab book.

If the AC are not met—for instance, if the positive control fails to lower migration below 75% of the control or if the negative control unexpectedly reduces migration—the test run is discarded, and the assay must be repeated. This rejection and the reasons for it are also documented in the experimental records for traceability.

However, it does not address the possibility or extent of repeated measures from the same dish, which is part of the question. This omission affects the completeness of the response.","Based on the provided protocol details, a “data point” is defined as one concentration condition (with all its technical replicates counted as a single data point) from one biological replicate (thus excluding all calibration/control wells).

The protocol estimates that 16 plates can be run in one week, which would normally yield 16 × 12 = 192 data points per week. However, using the assumption of three working weeks per month, the calculation becomes:

  192 data points/week × 3 weeks/month = 576 data points per month

Regarding repeated measures, the assay does not include true “longitudinal” repeated measures over separate time points in the same dish. Instead, each dish is imaged for the endpoints only once at the appropriate time (with migration and viability endpoints determined from the same dish after compound treatment), meaning that although two endpoints are measured, they are acquired in a single imaging session and are not repeated measurements over time.

It also does not fully address the decision rules for the solvent, filtering for sterility, or detailed procedures for adding test compounds to test systems.","Below is an overview of how compound stocks and dilutions are handled for the assay based on the provided document:

1. Compound Stocks and Solvent Choice  
• Compounds are first dissolved—typically the solid/powder is solved in 100% DMSO. DMSO is stored in a light‐proof, air‑tight bottle at room temperature.  
• The resulting compound solutions are aliquoted into single‐experiment volumes (one biological replicate) to avoid repeated freeze–thaw cycles that might damage compound stability.  
• In storage, compounds are kept according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (4°C, room temperature, or –20°C, as appropriate).  
_(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

2. Preparation of Dilutions  
• For running an experiment, a single aliquot is thawed and then diluted in “DMEM/F12 Advanced” (without supplements) in a deepwell plate.  
• The master plate dilutions are prepared so that every dilution contains 0.5% DMSO. A serial dilution (by default a 1:3 series, though a 1:1.5 dilution may be used if a narrower range is required) is performed in N2‑S medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF and FGF and with 0.5% DMSO.  
• The highest compound concentration is diluted 1:200 in medium without additional DMSO because the stock already provides the 0.5% DMSO level.  
_(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

3. Lab Ware and Dispensing Instruments  
• Pipetting volumes for the final test application are low: 25 µl of a 5× concentrated compound dilution is added to each well.  
• The dispensing is carried out using multichannel pipettes (or a multichannel‐multistepper pipette) to allow for consistent and precise addition into a 96‑well plate.  
• Dilutions are prepared in deepwell plates, and only the inner 60 wells of the 96‑well plate are used (with the edge wells filled with PBS to avoid edge effects).  
_(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

4. Temperature/Lighting and Buffer Considerations  
• Compounds are generally handled under conditions that minimize degradation. This includes pre‐warming the medium (such as N2‑S medium) before addition, ensuring that cells are not exposed to room temperature for prolonged periods during critical steps.  
• No explicit mention of special lighting requirements for compound handling is given, so standard laboratory lighting precautions are assumed.  
_(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

5. Solubility and Sterility Checks  
• The method notes that compound solubility may be an issue if stocks or dilutions are too low. To counter this, compounds are originally solved in 100% DMSO, ensuring sufficient solubility even when diluted to a final concentration of 0.1% DMSO in the test system.  
• Although the document reminds users to consider compound solubility, there is no explicit mention of a filtering step for sterility. Instead, ensuring sterility is managed by preparing aliquots for single experiments and avoiding repeated freeze–thaw cycles.  
_(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

6. Final Addition to the Test System  
• The timeline of compound addition is fixed: on Day 1 of the assay—after the cells have been allowed to adhere and commence migration—a 25 µl volume of the 5× concentrated compound dilution is added directly into the wells.  
• At this point, the wells already contain pre-warmed, fresh N2‑S medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml each of EGF and FGF.  
• The compounds are added to the cells already in the culture dish (with silicone stoppers removed from a circular cell‑free area), ensuring that test compounds are uniformly exposed to the cells during the 24‑hour incubation period.
_(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

In summary, compounds are prepared as DMSO stocks that are aliquoted and stored to avoid freeze–thaw damage. Dilutions are made in DMEM/F12 Advanced and then further serially diluted in N2‑S medium (with cytokines and a consistent DMSO content) using deepwell plates and multichannel pipettes. The final 25 µl addition (from a 5× dilution) is applied to the wells on Day 1 after the cells are in culture, ensuring controlled exposure to the compounds under pre-warmed conditions.",0.8492919877378213,0.20505821704864502,-0.03945791348814964,0.07361440360546112

Adherence to the plate maps is ensured by pipetting the technical replicates in a defined left-to-right pattern, with the highest concentration consistently placed in the top row. Any deviations from the pre-defined plate map—such as a pipetting error (for example, pipetting twice in one well)—are immediately marked on the plate maps.

It also describes known pitfalls and potential operator mistakes, providing a complete and relevant response.","Below is a summary of known problematic compounds, difficult‐to‑control experimental variables, and critical handling steps with the corresponding robustness/pitfall factors:

1. Problematic compounds:
 • Compounds with low solubility during preparation or dilution are an issue. The stock should be dissolved in 100% DMSO so that the final solvent concentration on the cells is 0.1% (low solubility can lead to precipitation) (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Uncertainties and troubleshooting” section).
 • Compounds that display autofluorescence may interfere with the detection of calcein‑AM or H‑33342 used for imaging, causing interference with the analytical endpoints (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Uncertainties and troubleshooting” section).

2. Difficult experimental variables:
 • Autofluorescent compounds pose challenges by interfering with fluorescence-based detection.
 • Pipetting accuracy is critical. Errors can occur if substance droplets are not injected properly – for example, pipetting too high above the medium may result in droplets sticking to the well wall instead of mixing (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Uncertainties and troubleshooting” and “Handling details of the test method” sections).
 • Focusing failures of the high content imaging system (e.g., the Array Scan VTI HCS Reader) can produce outliers. This is a technical variable that demands careful verification (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Uncertainties and troubleshooting” section).

3. Critical handling steps and robustness issues:
 • Maintaining proper cell density during seeding and differentiation is essential. Too low or too high cell numbers can lead to detachment or spontaneous differentiation.
 • Fast handling is required during the freeze/thaw processes. Cells must be processed quickly to avoid prolonged exposure to 10% DMSO, which decreases viability (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Variability and troubleshooting of source cells” section).
 • During compound addition, the transfer of droplets must be performed with precision using multichannel pipettes. Incorrect pipetting (e.g., droplets not contacting the medium surface correctly) can jeopardize the compound’s distribution (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Handling details of the test method” section).
 • Operator training is critical. The assay requires experience in cell culture, multichannel pipetting, and use of the imaging system. Even small mistakes in setting up the assay (such as pipetting errors, inaccuracies in dilution steps, or delays during medium change) can lead to significant variability in migration readouts and viability assessments (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Operator training” and “Uncertainties and troubleshooting” sections).

Overall, the assay’s robustness can be influenced by the compound properties (solubility and fluorescence), technical issues during imaging (focusing and signal interference), and critical execution steps (rapid handling during freeze/thaw and precise pipetting). Consistent operator training and careful attention in each step are essential to minimize these pitfalls.

b) In terms of alternative analytical methods to assess the same endpoints, the method can be adapted by measuring cell viability using different readouts. Instead of using calcein‐AM/H‑33342 imaging, one can employ fluorimetric resazurin conversion assays, extracellular LDH quantification, or ATP‐based luminescence assays.

c) For exposure schemes, although the standard protocol uses a 24‑h exposure period, the exposure time can be modified—for instance, prolonged toxicant exposure up to 48 hours is feasible. It is noted that a prolonged exposure may amplify toxic effects on both viability and cell proliferation. Repeated exposure paradigms could also be considered, depending on the research question.

d) Regarding experimental variations, several modifications can be implemented:  
 • The use of specific media or adjustments in the serial dilution (e.g., adapting from 1:3 to 1:1.5) can be done to achieve a more narrow dose range.  
 • The inclusion of proliferation inhibitors such as AraC (cytosine arabinoside) may be used to reduce the contribution of cell division to migration measurements.  
 • Different iPSC-derived NCC sources or modifications in coating conditions can also be explored to optimize or alter the test outcome.

It lacks information on background correction, normalization, or how summary metrics like EC50 or PoD are calculated, which are crucial to fully addressing the question.","The raw data processing starts once images are acquired by the Array Scan VTI HCS Reader. For example, the microscope produces 8‑bit TIFF images that are exported and then loaded into the Ringassay software (http://invitrotox.uni-konstanz.de/). This software estimates the previously cell‑free area and counts the number of H‑33342 and calcein double‑positive (viable) cells in the region of interest (ROI). An Excel file is then generated that contains the number of viable cells for each well (after the initial image analysis and cell quantification). (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, see “Quantification of migration” section)

Next, the same wells are analyzed for cell viability using a second image analysis algorithm (via ArrayScan VTI software) to detect individual viable cells. The generated data (cell counts from migration and viability assessments) are collected into one Excel sheet. (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Quantification of individual viable cells by imaging”)

Subsequent background correction is achieved by using measurements from the appropriate controls. In practice the medium control or the solvent (untreated) control wells are used to define the background levels and serve as the normalization baseline. Both migration and viability data are normalized relative to the untreated controls (for instance, migration values are expressed as a percentage of the untreated, solvent‑control cells). (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Test method exposure scheme and endpoints” and “Quantification of migration”)

For concentration–response analysis, the compiled data are further processed using Excel and GraphPad Prism. A curve is fitted to the data by non‑linear regression (the least squares method is used to generate a 4‑parameter log function). In situations where a non‑linear fit isn’t feasible, a linear regression is performed. Effective concentration values—for example, an EC25 value—is derived by solving the fitted function for 25% of the total scale (not based on the min‑max range). In addition, if parameters like BMC (benchmark concentration) and its confidence limits (BMCU and BMCL) are needed, these are calculated using dedicated online software (http://invitrotox.uni-konstanz.de/BMCeasy/). (Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Curve fitting” section)

Furthermore, statistical comparisons (such as one‑way ANOVA with non‑parametric Dunnett’s post-test or two‑way ANOVA + Tukey‑Kramer post hoc testing for comparing deviations versus controls) are performed to determine whether the treated conditions differ significantly from the control conditions, which provides additional support for the identification of points-of-departure (PoD) or hit classification.

In summary, the processing workflow is as follows:  
1. Image acquisition (background images and treatment images) followed by export in TIFF format.  
2. Automated cell count and ROI determination using the Ringassay software and ArrayScan algorithms.  
3. Generation of Excel files compiling data from multiple wells and technical replicates.  
4. Background correction and normalization by relating treated well data to the untreated (or solvent) control values.  
5. Curve fitting (primarily using a 4‑parameter logistic model via non‑linear regression; linear regression as fallback) in GraphPad Prism to derive EC25, EC50, or other relevant endpoints.  
6. Calculation of benchmark concentrations (BMC, BMCL/BMCU) via dedicated online tools and statistical evaluation of significance using ANOVA tests.

This complete data processing pipeline—from background subtraction to normalization and curve‐fitting—ensures that summary metrics like EC50, BMC values, ratios, and PoDs are reliably derived.

"How are data normally handled to obtain the overall test result (e.g. concentration response fitting using model X, determination of EC50 by method Y, use of EC50 as final data)? How do you model your concentration response curve (e.g. LL.4 parameter fit) and which software do you use (e.g. GraphPad Prism, R, etc.)? Do you usually calculate an uncertainty measure of your summary data (e.g. a 95% confidence interval for the BMC or a BMCL), and with which software? Can you give uncertainty for non-cytotoxicity or no-effect? How do you handle non-monotonic curve shapes or other curve features that are hard to describe with the usual mathematical fit model?","The data are analyzed with Excel and represented with GraphPad Prism. For the concentration curve, a nonlinear regression fit is calculated. The fitting method is least squares. If a non-linear curve fit is not possible, a linear curve fit is performed. The curve deriving from the fit is a 4- parameter log function. To calculate the EC25 value, this log-function is solved for y=25% of the total scale, not for 25% of the min-max scale (see example below). Treated concentrations are analyzed for deviation from control. Sometimes it is analyzed whether the deviation of neurite growth is different from the deviation of viability via comparison of the means ± deviation using two-way ANOVA + Tukey-Kramer post hoc testing. Significance levels of data points compared to solvent control are determined via one-way ANOVA followed with non-parametric Dunnett’s post test. BMC values with their upper and lower confidence intervals (BMCU and BMCL) are calculated via the publically available online software: http://invitrotox.uni-konstanz.de/BMCeasy/ Figure 7: Exemplification of curve fit and relative effect responses",Medium,"The answer provides some relevant information about data handling, such as the use of Excel and GraphPad Prism for analysis, and mentions the use of nonlinear regression and least squares fitting. It also describes the calculation of EC25 and the use of ANOVA for statistical analysis. However, it lacks clarity and completeness in addressing all aspects of the question, such as how non-monotonic curves are handled, and does not fully explain the software used for uncertainty measures or how uncertainty is calculated for non-cytotoxicity or no-effect scenarios.","The cMINC assay data analysis follows a multi‐step procedure. First, images acquired via the Array Scan VTI HCS are exported (as, e.g., 8‐bit TIFF files) and the cell count data are compiled in Excel. For quantifying concentration–response relationships, a nonlinear regression is performed using least squares; the resulting curve is a 4‑parameter log (LL.4) function. In cases where a nonlinear fit is not feasible, a linear fit is applied instead. GraphPad Prism is used for these regression analyses and for curve visualization.  
 
Uncertainty is addressed by calculating benchmark concentration (BMC) values along with their upper and lower confidence bounds (BMCU and BMCL). This is done using the publicly available online tool (BMCeasy at http://invitrotox.uni-konstanz.de/BMCeasy/). For compounds that do not show an effect (e.g. non‑cytotoxicity or no-effect), uncertainty measures are generally based on the variability of the highest tested concentration (HTC) or may not be derivable in the same way as for active responses.  
 
For non‑monotonic response curves or other curve shapes that do not conform well to the standard 4‑parameter model, the approach is to either use a linear fit if the nonlinear model cannot be reliably applied or to flag these curves for manual inspection. In these scenarios, caution is taken when interpreting the EC values.

Which hazard(s) do(es) your test method (potentially) predict?",Migration of NCCs is an essential process during fetal development. Impaired NCC migration triggered genetically or by toxicants can lead to malformations and disorders e.g. Hirschsprung’s disease or Treacher- Collins syndrome. The cMINC assay models the effects of NCC migration under toxicant exposure. The test captures endpoints like spina bifida or cleft palate also measured during developmental toxicity regulatory studies.,Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by identifying the biological process (NCC migration) and some adverse outcomes (Hirschsprung’s disease, Treacher-Collins syndrome, spina bifida, cleft palate). However, it lacks clarity and completeness in linking the test method data to specific in vivo adverse outcomes, specifying the toxicological target, and detailing the toxicological events modeled. The potential hazards predicted by the test method are not explicitly mentioned.","The assay quantifies how toxicants impair the migration of human neural crest cells (NCCs) derived from iPSCs—a process that is critical during fetal development. Any interference with NCC migration may be causally linked to developmental malformations observed in vivo. For example, impaired migration may lead to neural tube defects, craniofacial malformations (e.g., cleft palate), and disorders such as Hirschsprung’s disease or Treacher‐Collins syndrome. 

More specifically, the toxicological target modeled is the NCC population itself, with the assay focusing on the biological process of cell migration (with a minor contribution from proliferation at the migration front). The method uses migration inhibition (with cytoskeletal regulators such as cytochalasin D and taxol as endpoint controls) as a proxy for the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and microtubule dynamics that drive cell movement. In parallel, cell viability is monitored to distinguish specific migration effects from overt cytotoxicity.

Thus, the scientific rationale is that any toxicant-induced impairment in the migration of NCCs—as measured by decreased numbers of cells entering the previously cell‑free area—is indicative of potential adverse developmental outcomes in vivo. In this way, the assay is used to predict developmental neurotoxicity hazards by identifying substances that specifically disrupt NCC migration without affecting overall cell viability.

What is a ‘hit’ if the test is used in screening mode (= hit definition, if different from above)?","Three different models are used: 1. prediction model for screening: hit = inhibition of NCC migration while viability is not changed: Migration ≤ 80% of DMSO control Viability ≥ 90% of DMSO control 2. prediction model for compound hazard evalaution: hit confirmation testing: EC10 Viability (V) / EC 25 Migration (M) ≥ 1.3 → specific migration inhibitor of NCCs 3. prediction model for borderline compounds: A ratio of BMC10 Viability (V) / BMCL25 Migration (M) ≥ 1.3 is considered a borderline hit. In some scenarios the viability does not reach the BMC10 Viability (V) necessary for the ratio calculations. In this case the highest tested concentration (HTC) was used. Schematic representation of the complete prediction model is shown in Fig. 8 below. Figure 8: UKN2 Prediction model classification tree A full overview with a schematic representation of the UKN4 prediction model can also be found in supplementary figure 3 of Blum et al., 2022.",Medium,"The answer provides some details about the prediction models used for different scenarios, including thresholds for screening and hazard evaluation. However, it lacks clarity and completeness in addressing the full scope of the question. It does not clearly define the borderline range for pseudo-dichotomized outcomes or provide a detailed rationale for the thresholds used. Additionally, the limitations of the prediction model and the toxicological rationale for the threshold settings are not explicitly discussed.","(i) For dichotomized outcomes the prediction model is defined as follows: a “hit” (toxic effect) is called when, after treatment, the migration of neural crest cells is reduced to 80% or less of the DMSO (solvent) control while cell viability remains at or above 90% of control. In other words, if migration ≤80% and viability is ≥90%, the compound is considered to have a specific inhibitory effect on migration that is not secondary to overt cytotoxicity. _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

(ii) For pseudo‐dichotomized outcomes—when a third (borderline) category is considered—a borderline range is defined via the ratio of concentration metrics: if the ratio of the EC10 for viability (V) to the EC25 for migration (M) is around 1.3, the compound is classified as borderline. In some cases, if viability does not reach EC10, the highest tested concentration (HTC) is used in the ratio calculation; compounds that fall in that “gray” ratio area are then considered borderline hits. _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

(iii) For multi‐class or continuous outcomes, the endpoints (migration and viability) are expressed as percent changes relative to the solvent control. Concentration–response curves are generated (typically using a 4‑parameter log function obtained via nonlinear regression), and thresholds such as EC25 for migration inhibition (or EC10 for viability reduction) are derived. The rationale for choosing thresholds (e.g. 80% migration relative to control, and ≥90% viability) is biologically based because a reduction below these levels is associated with adverse developmental outcomes (e.g. neural tube defects, craniofacial malformations). Furthermore, the baseline intra‐experimental variability (migration ~15% and viability ~6–10%) and inter‐experimental variability have been quantified to support the reliability of these thresholds. _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

Rationale and Limitations  
• The thresholds are set on a biological basis—80% migration is chosen because below this level the impairment is considered toxicologically relevant, whereas ensuring viability remains ≥90% indicates that the effect is not merely due to generalized cell death. In addition, mathematical considerations (such as the observed standard deviations in migration and viability measurements) support these cutoff values.  
• Limitations include:  
 – The test has inherent variability (intra‑ and inter‑experimental variations of approximately 15% and 10%, respectively) which may narrow the confidence in the borderline classification.  
 – The prediction model has not undergone formal OECD validation (e.g. ring trials), and positive control responses for migration may vary (e.g. cytochalasin D has yielded migration percentages between 30 and 70% across plates).  
 – The influence of ongoing cell proliferation (about 30% of cells undergoing mitosis during the assay) can also modestly affect the migration read‐out.  
 – These factors must be considered especially when applying the model in a screening context.

Hit Definition in Screening Mode  
In screening mode—a “hit” is defined as a compound that reduces neural crest cell migration below 80% of the solvent control while maintaining viability at or above 90%. This screening criterion ensures that only compounds with a specific migration inhibitory effect (and not general cytotoxicity) are flagged for further evaluation. _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_",0.8014938047612202,0.10745836794376373,-0.05646710842847824,0.02333349920809269

However, it lacks clarity on the statistical approaches or classifiers used, does not specify if the model applies to changes on both sides of controls, and does not address how data in the opposite direction are handled. The documentation is mentioned, but the explanation of sensitivity and specificity is incomplete.","Based on the context, the prediction model was set up as follows (Sources: cMINC(UKN2).pdf):

• Setup and training compounds: The model was initially established using a defined set of compounds. The training set included chemicals such as acrylamide, arsenic trioxide (As₂O₃), cadmium chloride (CdCl₂), lithium chloride (LiCl), PCB180, and retinoic acid. In addition, positive controls (cytochalasin D, taxol, colchicine) and endpoint‐specific controls (e.g. silver nitrate, cytarabine (AraC), aphidicolin, L‑homocysteine, MG‑132, staurosporine, triton X‑100) were used in the development (Pages 174–175).

• Testing of the prediction model: Following initial setup, the prediction model was applied to screen an 80‑compound library provided by the US NTP (Nyffeler et al., 2017) and later used in the context of a 120‑compound testing battery (Blum et al., 2022; Masjosthusmann et al., 2020). When the number of chemicals exceeds 50, it is described in terms of “80” and “120” chemicals rather than listing them individually.

• Documentation: The process is documented in several publications. Key documentation includes Nyffeler et al. (2016) for model establishment, Nyffeler et al. (2017) for the application with the NTP compound set, and subsequent publications by Blum et al. (2022) and Masjosthusmann et al. (2020).

• Data analysis and classification: Rather than using complex machine‐learning classifiers, the model is based on threshold criteria and ratios. For example, in the screening model a “hit” is defined as a reduction in migration to ≤80% of the DMSO control with viability remaining ≥90%. In the hazard evaluation model, a ratio of EC₁₀ (viability) to EC₂₅ (migration) ≥ 1.3 is required to confirm that the migration inhibition is specific and not just secondary to cytotoxicity. A similar ratio is used for borderline compounds (using BMC₁₀ and BMCL₂₅).

• Directionality of the prediction model: The test is designed to capture migration inhibition—that is, decreases in migration relative to controls while maintaining viability. Although migration induction (increases) can occur, it is noted to be complex in toxicological interpretation. Hence, in a standardized testing context only the unidirectional (decrease) endpoint is assessed. In effect, the prediction model is one‑sided. Data that show an increase (or “up‐regulation”) in migration or viability are not interpreted as toxic effects, and the model does not apply separate threshold rules for increases.

Thus, the prediction model relies on specific, threshold‐based criteria extracted from a defined set of test chemicals with documentation in several publications; it is built to capture decreases in migration (with maintained viability) and does not incorporate a two‑sided analysis.",0.8161622436034425,0.2893318831920624,0.016334127634763718,0.14110562205314636

Several performance parameters for the test were obtained in several separate evaluation rounds. A first evaluation was done during the first publication of the model and its applications (Nyffeler et al. 2016). Here, a panel of well-selected positive and negative controls have been tested. Accordingly, the specificity was 100% and the sensitivity was > 90 %. In dedicated experiments, S/N ratios of > 20 and a z’ of > 0.5 have been determined. The compound used as positive control cytochalasin D was run across 35 different assay plates. The migration percentage relative to the solvent control varied between 30 and 70% across all plates (Nyffeler et al. 2016, Supplementary S2). Later, the test has been used in screening campaigns, and real-live performance data under broader screen conditions have been obtained. The different performance data need to be considered, when a compound is a hit in a screen, or whether it has been specifically evaluated in a hit follow-up or a mechanistic project. A first screen application has been the NTP80 screen (80 compounds provided by the US NTP). Data are published in Nyffeler et al. 2017. A second screen application has been the cross systems case study of the EU-ToxRisk project. The baseline variation is indicated in Krebs et al., 2020. Moreover, an overview is given for 19 compounds on the BMC/BMCL ratio as measure of readout certainty. A third screen was performed in the context of the EFSA DNT test battery evaluation with 120 compounds (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). From this screen the following performance indicators were obtained: A: Specificity of DNT IVB: 100% → Also with cMINC as standalone assay in 17 `tool negatives´ tested (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). B: Sensitivity of DNT IVB: 82.7% → With cMINC combined in a full DNT battery and a selected set of 27 positive compounds with evidence for DNT (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). C: Baseline variation (intra-experimental) Migration: 14.8 ± 4.3% Cell viability: 6 ± 3% D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) Migration: 15.6% Cell viability: 9.7% E: Variation of a positive control run on each (inter-experimental) Migration: 32.2% Definition of values C-E C: Baseline variation (intra-experimental) is the mean coefficient of variation CV±SD of the CV of all replicates of the solvent control from each experiment across n>200 experiments. D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) is the variability across all independent experiments (n>200) after normalization based on the response of the lowest test concentration. It was assumed that the lowest test concentration does not affect any of the endpoints measured. E: Variation of a positive control run on each (inter-experimental) is the variability of the positive control across all independent experiments (n>40) after normalization. Example for a positive control that on average reduced the specific endpoint down to 40% (relative to solvent control) and a calculated variability of 50%: 0.5 x 40% = +/- 20% → The positive control with mean of 40% varies from 20% to 60%.",High,"The answer provides a comprehensive overview of the test method's performance parameters, including specificity, sensitivity, signal/noise ratio, z-factor, baseline variation, and inter-operator variations.

The answer also lacks clarity on special considerations relevant for IVIVE, only stating 'No special considerations known' without further explanation.","Below is a summary of what is provided and what is not available in the document:

1. Important parameters for calculating free compound concentrations are based on the binding characteristics of the medium. For the cMINC test medium (“UKN2”), the estimated lipid content is 2.8E–6 ml lipid per ml medium and the albumin concentration (as a proxy for protein content) is 5.6 µM _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “In vitro – in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE)” section)_.

2. No explicit information was found regarding the protein content (beyond albumin in the medium) or the lipid content of the cells, nor is a “cell volume” provided in the context of the test method.

3. The culture setup is based on multi-well plates. Although the assay description indicates that cells are plated in a 96‑well format (with only the inner 60 wells used to avoid edge effects), the document does not specify the actual medium volume per well or the surface area of the culture dish _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “Test method exposure scheme and endpoints” section)_.

4. Regarding IVIVE strategies/data: A three‐step, physiology‐based (PBPK) modelling approach has been used to evaluate the clinical relevance of in vitro concentrations. This analysis (as referenced in Zimmer et al., 2014) demonstrated that the in vivo plasma concentrations of tested compounds were in the same range as those used in the migration assay. However, the IVIVE discussion is not extensive, and it is not explicitly stated that the cMINC assay itself has been used directly for IVIVE beyond this comparative modelling approach _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “In vitro – in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE)” section)_.

5. Special considerations relevant for IVIVE (such as the potential for compound accumulation due to frequent medium changes and compound re‑addition, expression of efflux transporters like MDR1, or the capacity for xenobiotic metabolism of the test system) are not specifically addressed in the document. In short, no explicit concerns regarding compound accumulation or metabolism (for example, via glycoproteins or xenobiotic enzymes) are mentioned for this assay _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf, “In vitro – in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE)” section)_.

Thus, while basic medium composition relevant to free compound determination is provided, several parameters—cell lipid/protein content, cell volume, and detailed culture dish volume/surface area—are not specified; further, IVIVE work has been pursued via PBPK modelling with no special IVIVE considerations singled out for cMINC.",0.6389004462963344,0.3571145534515381,-0.03765473514795303,0.13161693513393402

However, it lacks detail on how the test method reacts to mixtures and UVCBs, specific areas to exclude or include, and does not address interference from other compounds.","Based on the available documentation:

1. The assay is designed to pick up substances that specifically impair NCC migration while sparing viability. It reliably detects compounds that affect cytoskeletal dynamics and hence cell migration—such as the positive controls (cytochalasin D, taxol, and lithium chloride) as well as developmental toxicants like acrylamide, arsenic trioxide, cadmium chloride, PCB180, and retinoic acid (the compounds used in prediction model evaluations). In contrast, compounds that cause a strong reduction in viability (below the 90% threshold) may not be detected as specific migration inhibitors even if they affect migration; in those cases, non‐specific toxicity would mask a migration-specific effect.  
_(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

2. The test protocol was developed and applied using individual, well‐characterized compounds. No specific data on mixtures or UVCBs (substances of unknown or variable composition, complex reaction products, or biological materials) are provided. Thus, it remains uncertain how the assay would perform with mixtures or UVCBs, and their evaluation might be challenging because the overall effect on migration versus overall cytotoxicity may be difficult to deconvolute.  
_(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

3. In terms of chemical class or physical–chemical properties, the assay is generally suitable for compounds implicated in developmental toxicity via interference with neural crest migration (e.g., pesticides, flame retardants, PCBs, drugs). However, volatile substances or chemicals with poor water solubility are problematic because the test uses an aqueous-based cell culture system and final DMSO exposure is tightly controlled (0.1%). Additionally, chemicals that are highly colored or autofluorescent (interfering with calcein‐AM and Hoechst 33342 staining) can lead to readout artifacts. No specific in vitro detection of neurotransmitters (for which the required receptors are not expressed) or endocrine disruptors (if the respective pathways are absent) is expected with this assay; that is, compounds whose primary mode‐of–action does not involve NCC migration are likely to be missed.  
_(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

4. Furthermore, as noted in the troubleshooting section, some chemicals are known to interfere with the fluorescent readouts (calcein‐AM/Hoechst 33342) due to autofluorescence or inherent coloration, and such interference can compromise the accurate detection of both migration and viability endpoints.  
_(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_

In summary, the assay will correctly pick up migration‐inhibiting agents that do not compromise viability and that act through mechanisms (e.g., cytoskeletal disruption) relevant to neural crest cell movement. It may fail with compounds that are overtly cytotoxic, mixtures/UVCBs (whose effects are not well defined), or substances with extreme physical/chemical properties—such as strong volatility, poor water solubility, or significant autofluorescence—that can interfere with the established fluorescent detection system. Additionally, compounds acting via mechanisms not affecting NCC migration (e.g. neurotransmitters or endocrine disruptors without the respective pathway present) would also likely be missed.",0.4713646278754847,0.17919009923934937,-0.2507624328136444,-0.07603757828474045

For instance, it has been considered as an element in the ESNA TS (Embryonic Stem cell–based Novel Alternative Testing Strategies) screening battery and, more generally, in DNT batteries where neural crest cell migration is a key endpoint _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_.

Strengths in such batteries include:

• Medium throughput with automated microscopy, which is an advantage compared to lower‐throughput methods such as the scratch assay or transwell migration assays.  
• Its ability to generate robust positive signals—positive “hits” (i.e. marked migration inhibition while viability is maintained) are biologically meaningful.  
• Part of an established prediction model with defined criteria (migration ≤ 80% and viability ≥ 90% relative to controls) that aids in decision making.

Weaknesses or restrictions include:

• In contrast to clear positive hits, negative results provide little information; a negative result does not necessarily rule out developmental neurotoxicity and therefore requires complementary assays for full hazard characterization.
• The assay is not fully comprehensive on mechanistic aspects by itself, meaning that while it flags potential effects (e.g. via cytoskeletal disruption), detailed mechanistic follow-up using additional endpoints or test systems is needed.
• Although it can be run as a stand-alone assay for screening purposes, it is best paired with other assays in a battery for confirming borderline findings or elucidating mechanisms further.

In comparison to similar tests, the cMINC assay’s automated, quantitative format and higher throughput make it an effective tool for initial screening. However, its main contribution is the unique assessment of NCC migration; it fills the gap in batteries by providing a rapid, medium‑throughput measure of a developmental process that is not addressed by methods like the scratch assay (which has lower throughput) or transwell assays.

Thus, its use is best positioned in a first-tier screening setting—especially for generating alerts—while recognizing that negative results will require follow-up with complementary tests to build a complete DNT hazard profile _(Source: cMINC(UKN2).pdf)_.",0.7190519673338851,0.30114662647247314,0.011401209980249405,0.14266425371170044

However, it lacks detailed information on deviations from published descriptions, such as specifics about plastic plate suppliers, cell numbers, endpoint measurements, and timing. Additionally, there is no prioritization of the publications or comments on the types of information each publication provides, such as test chemical lists or validation against other tests.","Below is a summary of how our current cMINC test method compares to published descriptions and which publications provide a comprehensive overview of the test system and the assay method.

1. Deviations from published descriptions  
 • Cell system generation: In earlier publications (e.g. Nyffeler et al., 2016), the method used a protocol developed in the context of the EU‐ToxRisk project. In the current version (V2.0), the main deviation is in the generation of the test system—the cell line is now generated from hiPSC using the IMR90_clone_#4 line from WiCell grown under feeder‑free conditions (Matrigel coating, E8 medium) instead of formerly used conditions.  
 • Plate and stopper details: The current protocol specifies the use of silicone stoppers from Platypus Technologies to create a defined cell‑free circular area. Although earlier descriptions refer to migration models, the present method clearly indicates the supplier and material aspects, which may differ from earlier versions that might have used different plastic ware.  
 • Seeding density and endpoint quantification: The current protocol details seeding at 100,000 cells/cm² and defines the migration region such that untreated controls yield 150–300 cells. Furthermore, endpoint measurements using calcein‑AM and Hoechst staining and imaging with an ArrayScan II HCS Reader (with subsequent analysis via the “Ringassay” software at http://invitrotox.uni-konstanz.de/) provide a precise quantification that might have been less detailed in previous descriptions.  
 • Timing/exposure scheme: The current assay follows a defined timeline (Day −1: coating/stopper placement, Day 0: removal of stoppers and medium change, Day 1: toxicant addition, Day 2: staining and image acquisition). While earlier publications also described 24‑h exposure windows, the present document emphasizes these timings and the subsequent imaging protocol which supports reproducibility.

If this is inhibited by cytochalasin D or taxol migration of NCCs is inhibited. c) A formal mechanistic validation has not been performed.",Medium,"The answer provides some relevant information about mechanistic validation, such as the expression of typical markers and the impact of certain inhibitors on cell migration. However, it lacks completeness as it does not fully explore how the system reflects human biology or tissue organization relevant to the specific form of toxicity. Additionally, it explicitly states that a formal mechanistic validation has not been performed, indicating a gap in the validation process.","The assay employs endpoint‐specific controls as part of its mechanistic validation. For example, compounds such as cytochalasin D and taxol are used as mechanistic control compounds (MCC) that inhibit key cytoskeletal processes (actin polymerization and microtubule dynamics) crucial for cell migration (cMINC(UKN2).pdf, section “Endpoint-specific controls / mechanistic control compounds”). Moreover, while formal mechanistic validation has not been fully performed, the assay does include steps that support the relevance of the cellular system to human biology. The neural crest cells (NCCs) used in the assay express typical NCC markers (e.g., HNK1, p75, AP2, nestin) – indicating that they are in the appropriate developmental state – and they display migration behavior that models key in vivo developmental processes associated with craniofacial and neural tube formation (cMINC(UKN2).pdf, sections “Definition of the test system as used in the method” and “Steps towards mechanistic validation”). 

In addition, although specific omics characterization data are not yet published, transcriptomics data generated from the system are indicated to be available upon request, which further supports future mechanistic insights (cMINC(UKN2).pdf, section “Omics characterization of the test system”). 

In summary, while formal mechanistic validation is still pending, the use of endpoint‐specific controls and the expression profile of the NCCs provide evidence that the assay reflects relevant aspects of human biology and developmental processes.

The test method was developed using a compound training set (Nyffeler et al. 2016). It was used for an 80 compound screening library from the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) (Nyffeler et al. 2017). The test method was part of a DNT hazard assessment for 120 compounds in a DNT testing battery.

It mentions the use of a compound training set and specific screening libraries, addressing the question fully and with relevant details.","The test system has been qualified by screening a diverse set of compounds, but it has not received a formal validation via OECD studies or inter-laboratory ring trials. In more detail:

• Pre‐validation/validation activities include assessing the assay’s performance by testing a wide range of compounds. Specifically, 141 unique compounds (as defined by unique DTXSIDs) have been successfully tested, and in total more than 200 different compounds have been evaluated.

• The assay was initially developed and refined using a training set of compounds as described by Nyffeler et al. (2016). It was then applied in screening exercises, including an 80-compound library provided by the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) (Nyffeler et al., 2017) and later a 120-compound library as part of a larger developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing battery (Blum et al., 2022). These studies provided performance parameters such as sensitivity and specificity for the assay.

• Although these activities serve as a strong proof-of-concept and support test qualification, no formal OECD 34 validation study (e.g., ring trials with standardized controls) has been performed.
