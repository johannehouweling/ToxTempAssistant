Please describe in no more than 200 words the following:,,,,"The MitoComplexesLUHMES (MCL) assay is an in vitro method developed to assess compound‐induced impairments in mitochondrial complex activity (cI, cII, cIII, cIV) in human dopaminergic LUHMES cells. It involves seeding proliferative LUHMES cells on coated Seahorse XFe24 plates and allowing them to adhere and grow, before replacing the culture medium with a MAS buffer enriched with ADP and digitonin to permeabilize the cells. Using the Seahorse XF Analyzer, the assay measures the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) prior to and after the sequential injection of selective substrates and inhibitors. A two‐tiered screening approach is employed: tier 1 assesses cI (using pyruvate, glutamine, malate, and a cII inhibitor) and cIII (using duroquinol and a cI inhibitor), while tier 2 evaluates cII (using succinate and a cI inhibitor) and cIV (using TMPD, L-ascorbic acid, and a cII inhibitor). The assay provides mechanistic insights into mitochondrial disturbances that may underlie neurotoxicity, with careful internal and external quality controls ensuring reliability.

• Origin & Identity  
 – Derived from the ventral mesencephalon of an 8‐week-old human female fetus. (Source: Section 3.3)  
 – The LUHMES cells used are from the University of Konstanz working stock, originally brought from Lund (Sweden) in 2006. (Source: Section 3.1)

• STR Signature  
 – A short tandem repeat profile is available (e.g., CSF1PO: 13,14; D5S818: 11,13; D13S317: 9,11; D7S820: 11,13; further markers provided). (Source: Section 3.3)

• Passage Number & Culture Conditions  
 – Working stock cells are used only up to passage 18. (Source: Section 3.4)  
 – Routine culturing is performed with cells cultured until passage numbers between 20–25 from each thawed vial.  
 – Acceptable cell mortality in culture is ~5–10% (cell death observed as floating cells); extensive cell death warrants discarding the batch. (Source: Section 3.4)

• Morphology & Growth Characteristics  
 – Cells display an oval morphology and are inspected for lack of extensive aggregates. (Source: Section 3.4)  
 – Doubling time is approximately 14–20 hours, with some dependence on passage number. (Source: Section 3.3)  
 – Cells require a confluency of about 80% before seeding and should be evenly distributed. (Source: Section 4.2)

• Expression Profile / Marker Genes  
 – LUHMES cells exhibit a dopaminergic phenotype and express markers such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the presence of cAMP, and also express α‐synuclein alongside other standard synaptic proteins. (Source: Section 3.3)

These defined features (quantitative parameters like cell doubling time and passage number, STR signature, morphology, and marker gene expression) ensure reproducibility and identity of the starting LUHMES cell population used in the MCL assay.

How stable are your cells over several passages? Which passage(s) are valid? For primary cells: Show stability and identity of supply; demonstrate stability of function (e.g. xenobiotic metabolism).

Cells of the working stock are checked for marker gene expression once the stock is created, but not every thawed cell batch is checked. There only visual inspection is done. The cells should be of oval morphology, and should not form extensive aggregates and clustering. Approx. 5- 10% of cell death (dead cells floating in flask) is considered normal, increased cell death one passage after thawing justifies to discard of the cell batch. Culture medium should not be yellow. Proliferating cells from working stock batches should only be used up to passage 18.",Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by mentioning some acceptance criteria such as pathogen-free status, morphology, and passage limits. However, it lacks clarity and completeness in several areas: it does not specify quantitative definitions for acceptance criteria, does not address functional parameters or pluripotency control for iPSCs, and does not mention exclusion criteria or special requirements for genetically-modified cells. The response is missing details on stability over passages and does not cover primary cells or microphysiological systems.","The quality criteria for the proliferating LUHMES cells used in the assay are defined primarily based on their morphology, viability, and lack of contamination. Specifically:

1. The cells must be pathogen‐free (with regular mycoplasma tests performed after thawing) and should show no signs of contamination. In practice, only a visual inspection is done on each thawed batch (Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf, section 3.4). 

2. Acceptable cell morphology requires the cells to be oval and evenly dispersed without forming extensive aggregates or clustering. Approximately 5–10% cell death (evident as dead cells floating in the flask) is considered normal; any noticeable increase in cell death, particularly in the passage immediately following thawing, is grounds for batch exclusion (Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf, section 3.4).

3. The culture medium should remain in good condition (e.g., not turning yellow), which is indicative of healthy cell metabolism and low contamination.

4. Only cells from working stocks up to passage 18 are considered acceptable because higher passages may affect cellular function and behavior (Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf, section 3.4).

5. Additional quality is confirmed when cells display the expected proliferative status (around 80% confluency before seeding) and even distribution on the day of the assay (Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf, section 4.2). This helps ensure that the functional parameters (such as mitochondrial activity measured later) are based on a well-characterized, intact cell population.

No criteria related to pluripotency or primary cell stability (e.g., xenobiotic metabolism) are applicable here since the assay uses a continuously expanded human neuronal cell line. The acceptance and exclusion criteria are set to ensure that only healthy, non-contaminated cells with the correct morphology and acceptable passage numbers (≤ passage 18) are used. This minimizes variability and maintains the test's reliability.

The response could be more comprehensive and detailed to fully address the question.","Known factors affecting the variability of the initial/source LUHMES cells include:

1. Source cell batch and passage‐related variability. Cells from different working stock vials or of higher passage (beyond passage 18) may show altered morphology and behavior, leading to variability in performance. (Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf, sections 3.4–3.5)

2. Consumable and coating reagent issues. The quality and batch of critical consumables are essential. For instance:
 • The plastic ware (plates/flasks) is a critical factor – different lots or suppliers may have slight differences that affect cell attachment and distribution.
 • Coating reagents (poly-L-ornithine and fibronectin) require strict adherence to protocol. Issues with water quality or differences in coating batches can lead to clumping and uneven cell distribution. The protocol even suggests remedial steps (such as washing twice after coating or using PBS instead of MilliQ water) when coating problems occur. (Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf, sections 3.5 and 3.7)

3. Critical handling steps and influencing factors include:
 • Cell density must be carefully controlled – too low or too high confluency (recommended range is 40–90%) may impair cell behavior.
 • Seeding and medium change steps need to be performed quickly to minimize time at room temperature. Rapid handling is required to preserve cell viability and avoid metabolic disturbances.
 • Pipetting needs to be performed gently and accurately (preferably with multi‐step pipettes and by following a left-to-right, top-to-bottom approach) to ensure even cell distribution and minimize errors.
 • Visual inspection is critical; only cells exhibiting the expected oval morphology without extensive aggregates should be used.
( Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf, sections 3.5 and 6.5)

4. Special considerations for genetically modified cells and microphysiological systems:
 • LUHMES cells used in this assay are genetically modified (containing a v-myc and tet-off system). It is essential to use cells from the same working stock to avoid variability due to subtle differences between stocks (e.g. differences observed with cells maintained and distributed by sourcing from ATCC versus the established UKN stock).
 • Although the protocol does not use a microfluidics system per se, similar assays in microphysiological systems would require careful attention to matrix chemistry, geometry, and the microenvironment (e.g. ensuring consistent diffusion conditions between surface and core cells), so maintaining consistency in plate format and supplier is likewise critical.
( Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf, sections 3.3 and 3.5)

Recommendations to increase reproducibility and performance:
 • Always use cells within the recommended passage number (up to passage 18) and from the same working stock to avoid batch-to-batch variability.
 • Standardize consumables by using the same suppliers and lots for plastic ware and coating reagents, and adhere rigorously to the coating and washing procedures.
 • Implement strict timing during critical steps such as seeding, medium replacement, and compound addition. Minimize cell exposure to room temperature and use careful, consistent pipetting techniques.
 • Document immediately any deviations (e.g. discrepancies in coating, seeding density, or pipetting delays) so that troubleshooting can be accurately conducted and corrective measures can be applied.
 • Train operators extensively (approximately 4 weeks as suggested) to ensure that handling variability is minimized.

Special/additional requirements apply to microphysiological systems and organoids: e.g. cell printing, self-aggregation/self-organisation process, interaction with the matrix, geometrical characterization (size/shape), etc.",,Low,No answer provided; treated as missing.,"In the MCL assay no full differentiation protocol is applied because the test system is based on LUHMES cells maintained in their proliferative (precursor) stage. Although LUHMES cells have the capacity to differentiate into mature dopaminergic neurons through a well‐established protocol (by exposure to tetracycline, GDNF, and db‐cAMP for approximately 6 days), this is not performed here. Instead, the following procedure is used:

1. Cells are derived from a master stock and propagated as working stocks. They are first expanded in proliferation medium—Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 2 mM L‑glutamine, N2, and 40 ng/ml FGF—and cultured with regular medium changes (see Section 3.1 and 3.7).  
2. Culture vessels (plates or flasks) are pre‐coated with a solution of poly‑L‑ornithine (43 µg/ml) and fibronectin (1 µg/ml). This ensures even cell distribution and proper attachment.  
3. For the assay, proliferating LUHMES cells are trypsinized and re‑seeded into pre‑coated Agilent Seahorse XFe24-well plates in 100 µl of the proliferation medium. Depending on the desired assay timing, cells are seeded either 1 day (≈60,000 cells per well) or 2 days (≈40,000 cells per well) before measurement. After one hour of attachment, an additional 400 µl of proliferation medium is added (Section 4.1).  
4. Shortly before the ingestion of the test compound, the proliferation medium is completely replaced by MAS buffer freshly supplemented with 1 mM ADP and 25 µg/ml digitonin. This permeabilization step is critical to allow for the subsequent injection of complex-specific substrates and inhibitors during the assay (Section 4.1 and 6.1).

There is no phase in the protocol for re-plating during differentiation, nor are additional medium additives meant to induce maturation (such as tetracycline, cAMP, or GDNF) since the assay purposefully uses the cells in a non-differentiated state. In addition, as this is not a microphysiological system or an organoid model, there are no requirements related to cell printing, self-aggregation, matrix interactions, or geometrical characterization of size/shape (see special/additional requirements in the question, which do not apply for the MCL assay).

Thus, rather than a complete multi‐phase differentiation process with schematic phases and media changes that are typical for organoid and advanced 3D systems, the MCL assay focuses on the preparation of uniformly distributed, proliferating LUHMES cells (pre-coated well plates, controlled seeding density, and prompt buffer exchange) to allow accurate assessment of mitochondrial complex activity under exposure conditions.

The response is incomplete and does not provide a database link as requested.","Based on the provided document, a lab‐internal SOP for general cell maintenance is available as an external file (see section 3.7 of the document). In summary, the general maintenance procedure follows these points (all details from MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf):

• A maintenance culture protocol is in place—as documented in chapter 3—with cells grown in Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 2 mM L‐glutamine, N2 (1×) and 40 ng/ml FGF. Cells are passaged every 2–3 days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) ensuring that confluency does not drop below 40% or exceed 85%.

• Basic cell propagation follows a defined seeding scheme (for example, seeding 3 million cells per T75 flask for a 2‑day split) and careful visual inspection of cell morphology. There is no quantitative “purity” provided (e.g. 95% Oct4‐positive) since LUHMES cells are not iPSC but a dopaminergic cell line with defined marker expression (see sections 3.1–3.4).

• Quality control measures for each new working stock include routine pathogen testing (e.g. regular mycoplasma checks after thawing) and a check of marker gene expression when the working stock is created. In day‐to‐day work, only visual inspections are done for assessing clumping/aggregates and cell death (typically, 5–10% dead cells is acceptable; high cell death shortly after thawing leads to batch discard).

• Only cells from working stock up to passage 18 are used for the assay.

• Although the document does not explicitly mention adherence to GCCP or GIVIMP, the detailed standard operating procedures and regular cell bank generation suggest that accepted cell culture and in vitro test practices are followed.

• The frozen stocks and cell banks are prepared as follows: the original master stock (originating from cells brought from Lund, Sweden in 2006) is thawed and extensively expanded every 4–5 years to generate a working stock; then, every 4 weeks a vial from the working stock is thawed to propagate cells for experiments.

• As LUHMES is an established cell line, there is no description for primary cell inclusion/exclusion criteria.

After incubating for 1 (or 2) days as desired, the medium is replaced by MAS buffer freshly supplemented with ADP and digitonin right before the start of measurement.",Medium,"The answer provides specific details about the preparation and seeding of LUHMES cells, including cell density and medium conditions. However, it lacks information on the general features/principles of the culture protocol, such as collagen embedding, 3D structuring, or the addition of specific factors. It also does not address the percentage of contaminating cells, subpopulation sensitivity to cytotoxicity, or differential cytotoxicity of specific chemicals, which are key aspects of the question.","The assay uses UKN LUHMES cells as a relatively homogeneous population of human dopaminergic neuronal precursors in a 2D monolayer format. The cells are not differentiated into mature neurons prior to the assay; instead, they are maintained in a proliferative precursor stage and used immediately after plating onto Seahorse XF Analyzer plates.

Regarding the culture protocol, the cells are prepared as follows (see Sections 3.1, 3.7, and 4.1 of the document):  
• The plastic ware (flasks and plates) is coated with poly‑L‑ornithine (PLO; 43 µg/ml) and fibronectin (1 µg/ml) overnight.  
• LUHMES cells are then trypsinized and re‑seeded into these coated plates with a defined seeding density (either 60,000 cells per well for a 1‑day incubation or 40,000 cells per well for a 2‑day incubation) in proliferation medium (Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with L‑glutamine, N2, and FGF).  
• After an initial attachment phase of about 1 hour, additional medium is added, and the cells are allowed to grow until the assay.  
• Immediately before the test, the proliferation medium is replaced with MAS buffer that is freshly supplemented with ADP and digitonin.

No differentiation procedures (such as exposure to tetracycline, db‑cAMP, or GDNF for converting the cells into morphologically mature neurons) are applied in this assay. Therefore, no complex steps such as collagen embedding, 3D structuring, or the addition of mitotic inhibitors or other hormones/growth factors beyond those required for maintaining a proliferative state are involved.

Concerning contaminating cells and subpopulation details:  
• The assay documentation does not report any contaminating cell percentages. It only specifies that the cells must be free of detectable contamination (regular testing for mycoplasma post‑thaw and visual inspection for cell aggregates and abnormal morphology).  
• The protocol is based on a pure population of LUHMES cells with no co‑culture components. Therefore, there is no mention of different subpopulations or how their percentages might influence the assay endpoints.  
• Similarly, there is no indication that subpopulations (or differential sensitivity among them) affect cytotoxicity measures, nor is there any reported data on chemical classes showing differential cytotoxicity for potential sub‑populations.

Thus, the test system is a homogeneous culture of proliferative LUHMES cells prepared on coated plastic ware with no additional differentiation steps, no defined contamination levels or mixed subpopulations, and no data on differential sensitivity to cytotoxicity between sub‑populations.

However, it lacks detailed endpoints, specific acceptance criteria, analytical methods, and historical control data. The response is not comprehensive and lacks clarity on how the criteria are evaluated and what actions are taken if they are not met.","The MCL protocol does not include a suite of molecular or biochemical parameters (such as PCR‐based marker expression, ATP measurements, or immunostaining for specific proteins) to ensure that cultures are “as expected” right at the start. Instead, the quality and suitability of the test system are evaluated using largely qualitative, visually based endpoints. For example, before seeding into the assay, cells must have reached approximately 80% confluency. On the day of the assay the cells must be evenly distributed and display a normal, oval morphology without extensive aggregation or clustering. In addition, cell batches are checked for contamination (e.g. mycoplasma) and an acceptable level of cell death is acknowledged—typically about 5–10% cell death is considered normal, although an excess (especially one passage after thawing) would lead to discarding that cell batch. Routine checks using these visual/morphological endpoints are thus the primary acceptance criteria at the start of toxicity testing. In historical use, variations in these qualitative parameters (such as in cell morphology, confluency, and viability) would trigger a review of the cell batch, with the expectation that only cells meeting these criteria are advanced into the assay.

It only mentions oxygen levels and OCR, which are not directly related to the endpoints, parameters, or historical controls requested. It lacks details on differentiation, cell density, or actions if criteria are not met.","The assay requires that both the cells used as source material and the final test system meet several visual, functional, and procedural quality criteria. For example, the source cells must be pathogen‑free and display an oval morphology without extensive clustering or aggregate formation. A baseline level of cell death (approximately 5–10%) is acceptable, but any higher level—in combination with signs such as a yellowing of the medium—will lead to the batch’s discard. In addition, only proliferating cells up to passage 18 are used (Sections 2.4 and 3.4 of MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf).

For the test system, cells must be seeded under controlled conditions (e.g. 60,000 cells per well for a 1‑day culture) so that by the time of the assay the cultures show about 80% confluency and are evenly distributed. At the end of compound exposure the negative control wells should show no significant change in oxygen consumption rate (OCR). More specifically, oxygen levels should start at approximately 150 mmHg and must not drop below 60 mmHg during measurement (Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf).

Although detailed historical averages (e.g. of neurite length or fold-induction of a marker) are not provided in the document, the procedure relies on repeated quality checks through visual inspection and control measurements. If these acceptance criteria are not met (for example, if the negative control shows an aberrant OCR profile or if cell morphology appears compromised), the ongoing experiment is discarded and the cell batch is not used further—a new working stock or cell batch must be prepared (Sections 2.4, 4.2, and 4.3 of MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf).

Recommendations for reproducibility are implied but not explicitly stated, leading to a partial and somewhat unclear response.","Below is a summary of the identified sources of variability and recommendations to enhance reproducibility, as described in the document:

1. Causes of Variability and Critical Consumables:
 • Coating reagents and plastic ware: Variability may arise from using different batches of poly-L-ornithine (PLO) and fibronectin, or plastic supplies from different manufacturers or lots. Problems with plastic coating (e.g. inadequate washing, use of poor‐quality water, storing coated ware in the fridge) often lead to uneven cell distribution, clumping, or aggregation.  
 • Culture media and supplements: Variability can also come from differences between lots of medium components and supplements.  
 • Cell batch effects: Differences may occur between vials of the same cell lot and when using higher passage numbers (cells from working stock should be used only up to passage 18). This includes variations in cell morphology, confluency, and metabolic activity.  
  _(Sources: Annex A, Section 4.4; Annex A, Section 6.5)_

2. Critical Handling Steps and Influencing Factors:
 • Pipetting and timing: The protocol underlines the need for highly trained, consistent multistep pipetting. Critical steps such as cell seeding and medium change must be performed swiftly to minimize time at room temperature. Notably, on the assay day only two wells should be aspirated and refilled at once to reduce variability.  
 • Plate handling: Care must be taken with the Seahorse cartridge handling – setting the cartridge down harshly can cause premature compound injection, altering the final dose on the cells.  
 • Cell density: Ensuring a correct seeding density (60,000 cells per well for 1 day culture, or 40,000 cells per well for 2 day culture) and monitoring confluency (approximately 80% before seeding and visual confirmation of even distribution) are critical to prevent metabolic changes due to overconfluency or underattachment.  
  _(Sources: Annex A, Sections 4.4; 6.5; 4.1; 4.2)_

3. Controls and Their Expected Performance:
 • Negative Control: Typically, a solvent control (0.1% DMSO final concentration) is used; it is expected that the OCR remains stable (i.e. does not change significantly after control injections), with oxygen levels starting at approximately 150 mmHg and never dropping below 60 mmHg during the measurement. An additional negative control mentioned is MG132 at 100 nM.  
 • Positive (Mechanistic) Controls: For each mitochondrial complex, specific inhibitors serve as positive controls:
  – cI: 0.5 µM rotenone (expected to reduce cI activity significantly beyond the baseline variation of 2×SD)  
  – cII: 5 mM malonate  
  – cIII: 0.5 µM antimycin A  
  – cIV: Sodium azide  
  An uncoupler (1.5 µM FCCP) is also used as part of the test protocol for comparison.  
 • Expected Variability: The assay decision rule states that a complex is considered inhibited if its activity is decreased by more than 2×SD of baseline variation. While specific numerical deviations between repeats are not fully quantified in the protocol, this threshold serves as an internal consistency check between experiments.  
  _(Sources: Annex A, Sections 5.5; 4.3; 8.2)_

4. Recommendations to Increase/Ensure Reproducibility and Performance:
 • Use consistent batches for critical consumables such as coating reagents, plates, and media supplements. When a new batch is introduced, validate the coating quality (e.g. by performing additional washes or testing with PBS).  
 • Always use cells at a controlled passage (no higher than passage 18) and from the same working stock batch when possible to minimize biological variability.  
 • Provide thorough training for operators in LUHMES cell culture, multistep pipetting, and proper handling of the Seahorse XF Analyzer to reduce operator-induced variances.  
 • Minimize cell exposure at room temperature during seeding and medium changing, and aspirate/refill only two wells at a time on critical days (e.g. day 3) to maintain consistency.  
 • Ensure that compound handling adheres strictly to the protocol by dissolving in 100% DMSO, aliquoting for single-use to avoid repeated freeze–thaw cycles, and diluting immediately prior to the assay.  
 • Implement rigorous visual inspection criteria for cell density, confluency (aiming for about 80% confluency before seeding), and distribution on the assay day to catch any deviations early.

It only mentions mitochondrial complexes, which is not relevant to the question.","The assay’s test system uses cultured human LUHMES cells that, while displaying key aspects of dopaminergic neuron function (for example, expressing functional mitochondrial complexes as seen in vivo, see section 4.7), are still a simplified model compared to the complex structure and function of human brain tissue. In this system:

• The cells are used at a proliferative precursor stage rather than as fully mature neurons. This means that aspects such as full synaptic connectivity, long‐term neuronal network formation, and complete electrophysiological maturity seen in intact brain tissue may not be fully recapitulated (see sections 3.3 and 8.1).

• The assay involves an in vitro setup with permeabilization and direct substrate/inhibitor challenge (sections 4.1 and 5.1). This controlled environment does not mimic the in vivo extracellular matrix, vascular supply, or interactions with other cell types (for example, glial cells) inherent to human brain tissue.

These gaps of analogy should be taken into account when extrapolating the in vitro findings to potential in vivo neurotoxicity. In other words, while the test system shows clear mitochondrial complex function, its limited cellular maturation and absence of full tissue-level complexity mean that not all features of human central nervous system tissue are represented.

The timeline details key events from cell plating and medium changes to compound injection and measurement:

────────────────────────────────────────────
Time: –24 Hours (Day –1)
────────────────────────────────────────────
• Freshly re-plated proliferating LUHMES cells are seeded in Agilent Seahorse XFe24-well plates that have been pre-coated overnight with poly-L-ornithine (PLO at 43 µg/ml) plus fibronectin (1 µg/ml) (see Sections 3.7 and 4.1).  
• Seeding density:  
 – For a 1-day assay: 60,000 cells per well  
 – For a 2-day assay: 40,000 cells per well  
• Immediately after seeding, cells are allowed to attach (approximately 1 hour) before 400 µl of proliferation medium [Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, N2 supplement, and 40 ng/ml FGF] is added.  
• During this phase, the cells are sub-confluent (approximately 80% confluence at the time of seeding), ensuring even distribution and avoiding overconfluency.
────────────────────────────────────────────
Time: –24 to 0 Hours (Overnight Incubation)
────────────────────────────────────────────
• Cells remain in proliferation medium, without any compound exposure at this stage.  
• In parallel, about 1 day prior to the assay, the Seahorse XF Analyzer cartridge is rehydrated with XF Calibrant at 37°C (without CO₂), ensuring the instrument is ready for the run (Section 4.1).  
• No additional medium supplements or compounds are added during this period.
────────────────────────────────────────────
Time: 0 Hours (Assay Day – Start)
────────────────────────────────────────────
• Just before the measurement, the proliferation medium is carefully removed and replaced with freshly prepared MAS buffer.  
 – The MAS buffer is supplemented immediately before use with:  
  – 25 µg/ml digitonin  
  – 1 mM ADP  
• This medium change is critical to allow the permeabilization of cells and to support mitochondrial function during the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurement.
────────────────────────────────────────────
Time: 0 Hours and Onward (During the Seahorse Assay)
────────────────────────────────────────────
• Basal OCR is recorded using the Seahorse XF Analyzer.  
• Following the baseline measurement, a sequence of injections is performed via the cartridge ports:  
 • For Tier 1 testing:  
  – Injection of the test compound  
  – Subsequent addition of specific mitochondrial complex substrates (e.g., pyruvate, L-glutamine, malate for complex I) and inhibitors (e.g., 5 mM malonate for complex II inhibition) is done to evaluate cI and cIII activities.  
 • For Tier 2 testing:  
  – Similar procedure with tailored substrates and inhibitors (e.g., 10 mM succinate for complex II and TMPD/ascorbic acid for complex IV, with inhibitors as needed) (see Section 5.1 and 6.1).
• All OCR measurements are continuously recorded and normalized to the last reading before each compound injection.
• No re-addition of compounds is performed after the medium change; rather, compounds are diluted into the MAS buffer as 10x stock solutions (with final DMSO concentration of 0.1%) and loaded into the cartridge.  
 – Any medium change or wash step is done only once before starting the assay.
────────────────────────────────────────────
Critical Points & Medium Supplements:
────────────────────────────────────────────
• Coating: The plates must be pre-coated with PLO/fibronectin to ensure even cell distribution and to prevent clumping (Section 3.7).  
• Proliferation Medium: Contains critical supplements (FGF, N2, L-glutamine) to support cell health before exposure.  
• MAS Buffer: Must be freshly supplemented with ADP and digitonin right before measurement to permeabilize cells and maintain mitochondrial function.  
• Compound Addition: Compounds are only added during the assay (via cartridge injections) without any further medium changes, ensuring proper dosing and minimizing cell disturbance (Sections 5.1 and 6.1).
────────────────────────────────────────────

This timeline integrates the overall cell culture scheme (from seeding of sub-confluent, freshly re-plated, pre-coated LUHMES cells) with the subsequent medium change and sequential compound injection process necessary for measuring mitochondrial complex activity.

It also fails to mention any secondary endpoints or reference/normalization endpoints, making it incomplete and not directly addressing the question.","The primary endpoints of this assay are the individual activities of the mitochondrial complexes (complexes I, II, III and IV), as determined by oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurements. Cytotoxicity is not the primary endpoint of the method. Instead, the focus is on assessing mitochondrial function via complex-specific inhibition.

Secondary endpoints include control checks for unspecific effects such as ensuring that the baseline OCR remains stable in negative control conditions (e.g., solvent control with 0.1% DMSO). Additionally, while the assay does not primarily measure cytotoxicity, it is noted that LUHMES cells are highly sensitive to toxicants and cell death can be quantified (e.g., via LDH release); however, these are ancillary observations rather than formal endpoints.

For normalization, all OCR values in this assay are normalized to the last measurement taken immediately before compound injection. This baseline measurement is used as a reference to calculate the activity of each mitochondrial complex as a percentage of control. This internal normalization approach ensures that variations in cell number or cell status are accounted for without the need for additional external normalization measures such as protein content or housekeeping gene expression.

It provides a specific calculation method for complex activities but does not describe the principles of the analytical methods, key steps, or how endpoints are measured. It lacks the general overview required for understanding the method.","The assay is based on real‑time monitoring of oxygen consumption (OCR) in permeabilized LUHMES cells using a Seahorse XF Analyzer. The key principle is to determine the activity of mitochondrial complexes (cI–cIV) by injecting specific substrates and inhibitors in a sequential manner, and then comparing the induced OCR changes to basal measurements.

Key steps include:  
• Seeding proliferating LUHMES cells on coated Seahorse microplates and allowing them to attach (cells remain unfixed and intact).  
• Replacing the proliferation medium with MAS buffer that is freshly supplemented with digitonin (to permeabilize the cells) and ADP.  
• Recording a basal OCR level followed by sequential injections: one injection of the test compound along with substrates (and inhibitors) specific for each mitochondrial complex (tier 1: cI and cIII; tier 2: cII and cIV).  
• Normalizing the first OCR measurement after each injection to the pre-injection baseline and then to the respective control. This is done in the same well using sequential compound injections.

Since the assay is focused on mitochondrial complex function via OCR measurements, the cells are not fixed nor homogenized. The mitochondrial activity endpoints are measured consecutively in the same well during a single run; there is no parallel assessment of separate imaging endpoints.

"Provide information on machine settings, analytical standards, data processing and normalization procedures. For imaging endpoints: provide detailed algorithm. This information should also be covered in an SOP, preferably in DB-ALM format (see link in 6.6).",,Low,No answer provided; treated as missing.,"Based on the provided document, the following can be stated:

1. Machine settings and analytical standards  
 • The assay is performed on a Seahorse XF Analyzer. Prior to an experiment, the cartridge is rehydrated in XF Calibrant at 37°C (without CO₂) (Section 4.1). Oxygen levels are required to start at approximately 150 mmHg and must not drop below 60 mmHg during measurements (Section 4.3).  
 • The analytical standards consist of well‐established selective MRC complex substrates and inhibitors. For example, inhibitors and uncouplers used are:  
  – cI inhibitor: 0.5 µM rotenone  
  – cII inhibitor: 5 mM malonate  
  – cIII inhibitor: 0.5 µM antimycin A  
  – cIV inhibitor: sodium azide  
  – Uncoupler: 1.5 µM FCCP  
(Sections 5.5 and 5.7)

2. Data processing and normalization procedures  
 • Raw oxygen consumption data are recorded by the Seahorse XF Analyzer and initially stored in .asyr files along with metadata (Section 7.1).  
 • Outliers due to technical issues (e.g., missed focus or channel imaging errors) are visually identified and discarded (Section 7.2).  
 • All OCR values are first normalized to the last measurement before compound injection. Then, the first OCR measurement after a specific substrate injection is compared to the average of the corresponding controls. Thereby, the activity of each mitochondrial complex is expressed as a percentage of control (Sections 5.3 and 7.3).  
 • Data analysis (curve fitting, nonlinear regression via a 4‑parameter log function or, when necessary, a linear fit) is performed using Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism. Additional statistical evaluations (ANOVA, post hoc tests) can also be applied (Section 7.4).

3. Imaging endpoints and detailed algorithm  
 • Although the protocol mentions that cells can be fixed for microscopy, no detailed algorithm for image analysis is provided in the document.  
 • The document indicates that an SOP describing detailed procedures—including those for any imaging endpoints—is available in lab‐internal documents and in DB‑ALM format (see Section 6.6). However, the current document does not list a step‑by‑step image analysis algorithm.

In summary, while machine settings, the use of analytical standards, and the data processing/normalization strategy (focused on OCR measurements) are described with references to the relevant sections, specific details on imaging endpoints (including a detailed algorithm in DB‑ALM format) are not provided in the current document. The SOP covering these aspects is noted as available on request (Sections 6.6 and 4.9).

1. Rotenone (0.5 µM)  
 • Why: It is a well‐established inhibitor of complex I. Its use is mechanistically plausible because it directly decreases complex I activity.  
 • Expected Data: A significant reduction of the normalized OCR attributed to complex I.  
 • Day-to-day AC: Yes, it is routinely used to set acceptance criteria for complex I inhibition.  
 • Response: Complex I inhibition correlates with a decreased test method response.

2. Malonate (5 mM)  
 • Why: It serves as an inhibitor of complex II by competing with the substrate; its effect is well documented.  
 • Expected Data: A marked lowering of complex II activity measured as a decrease in the OCR after substrate injection.  
 • Day-to-day AC: Yes, it is used for routine performance monitoring of complex II activity.  
 • Response: Inhibition of complex II correlates with a decreased OCR in the assay.  
  _(Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf)_

3. Antimycin A (0.5 µM)  
 • Why: This compound is a specific inhibitor of complex III, leading to reduced electron transfer.  
 • Expected Data: A clear drop in the OCR when complex III activity is measured.  
 • Day-to-day AC: Yes, it is applied regularly to confirm assay sensitivity for complex III inhibition.  
 • Response: The decreased OCR confirms mechanistic inhibition of the pathway.  
  _(Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf)_

4. Sodium Azide  
 • Why: Sodium azide is used to inhibit complex IV and is a standard control for that endpoint.  
 • Expected Data: Markedly reduced complex IV activity, which is reflected in lower OCR levels after the appropriate substrates are added.  
 • Day-to-day AC: Yes, it is included for consistent monitoring of complex IV performance.  
 • Response: Inhibition of complex IV leads to a decrease in the test method’s OCR readout.  
  _(Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf)_

5. FCCP (1.5 µM)  
 • Why: FCCP is an uncoupler; in the context of complex I, it can induce an increase in OCR (i.e. uncoupling) when the mitochondrial membrane potential is collapsed.  
 • Expected Data: An increase in the OCR—if the measured response exceeds more than 2×SD of baseline variation, this can be taken as a clear indication of FCCP-mediated uncoupling.  
 • Day-to-day AC: Yes, it serves as a functional control particularly when assessing the capacity for mitochondrial uncoupling and verifying that the assay can detect increases in OCR under uncoupling conditions.  
 • Response: While inhibition controls lead to decreased OCR values, FCCP will drive an increase, which is a correlated, measurable change in the test method response.  
  _(Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf)_

Additional Note:  
A negative control (e.g. solvent control with 0.1% DMSO, sometimes supplemented by 100 nM MG132 as an unspecific control) is used to ensure that compounds do not trigger unspecific changes. However, for MCC purposes the focus is on those compounds that trigger mechanistically plausible and reproducible changes in mitochondrial complex activity.  

In summary, the inhibition of each mitochondrial complex by its respective MCC (rotenone, malonate, antimycin A, sodium azide) shows a direct decrease in the measured OCR, while the FCCP-induced uncoupling results in an increased OCR response. These changes in the test endpoint (OCR) correlate with the mechanistic pathway inhibition or activation, thus confirming the specificity and functionality of the assay.

What chemicals/manipulations are used as positive controls? Describe the expected data on such controls (signal and its uncertainty)? How good are in vivo reference data on the positive controls? Are in vivo relevant threshold concentrations known?,,Low,No answer provided; treated as missing.,"The protocol does not define an independent “positive control” per se. Instead, the assay employs endpoint‐specific mechanistic control compounds to validate each mitochondrial complex readout. For example, control compounds used include 0.5 µM rotenone for complex I, 5 mM malonate for complex II, 0.5 µM antimycin A for complex III, sodium azide for complex IV, and 1.5 µM FCCP as an uncoupler (Section 5.5, MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf).

Regarding the expected data on such controls, the document does not provide detailed quantitative expectations or a defined signal uncertainty. In general, the prediction model is based on a change exceeding two times the baseline standard deviation to call a complex inhibited (Section 8.2, MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf), but no specific uncertainty ranges are given for these controls.

Furthermore, there is no information provided on the quality of in vivo reference data for these compounds, nor are any in vivo-relevant threshold concentrations known.

MG132 100 nM.,Low,"The answer provides minimal information about the negative controls, only mentioning 'solvent (0.1% DMSO final concentration)' and 'MG132 100 nM' without any explanation. It does not describe the expected data on such controls, the rationale for concentration settings, or whether unspecific controls are used. The response lacks clarity and completeness in addressing the question.","The assay uses a dual negative control strategy. One part is the solvent control, where cells are exposed to 0.1% DMSO. The rationale for using 0.1% DMSO is that this concentration is sufficient to dissolve the test compounds while being low enough to avoid any toxic or mitochondrial effects on the cells. In these conditions, the baseline oxygen consumption rate (OCR) should remain stable (with oxygen levels starting around 150 mmHg and not dropping below 60 mmHg) and not change significantly after the control injection; the variability (i.e. background noise) is defined by the baseline standard deviation (with a compound considered to have an effect only if the change exceeds 2 × SD of that baseline variation).

In addition, an unspecific control is used: MG132 at 100 nM. This compound is employed to monitor non‐selective (unspecific) effects that might arise during the assay. The selected concentration (100 nM) is based on prior experience ensuring that MG132 does not interfere with the mitochondrial complex activity and thereby serves as a benchmark for non‑mitochondrial, unspecific effects.

Which rule do you apply to test whether a test run is within the normal performance frame? How do you document this decision? Indicate actions if the AC are not met.,,Low,No answer provided; treated as missing.,"The assay’s performance is judged by verifying that the run meets the predefined acceptance criteria. In practice, you check that on the negative control wells the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) remains stable (i.e. without significant change upon control injection), that oxygen levels start at roughly 150 mmHg and do not fall below 60 mmHg (see Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the document). This “rule” means that if the negative control does not remain stable (or if the oxygen parameters are outside these windows), the test run is not within the normal performance frame.

This decision is documented by recording all the observed parameters (such as OCR values before and after compound injection, starting oxygen levels, and any deviations) in the metadata of the experiment, the plate maps, and the paper lab book, as outlined in Section 6.2 on day-to-day documentation.

If the acceptance criteria are not met—for example, if there is an unexpected change in OCR in the negative controls or the oxygen levels do not stay within the required range—then the run must be flagged as a technical failure. In such a case, troubleshooting steps are initiated (e.g. checking cell confluency, cell distribution, proper coating, and reagent quality), and the experiment is repeated with a new cell batch and fresh reagents.

The explanation of the estimate is not fully addressed, and the answer could be more concise and focused on the specific question asked.","Based on the throughput estimate described in section 5.10 of the document, each plate set provides 6 data points (each representing one concentration/condition, with technical replicates counted as one), and two plate sets can be run per day—that gives 12 data points per day. The document assumes 4 readout days per week (i.e. 4 days when measurements are taken), which under a 4‑week month would yield 48 data points per week × 4 = 192 data points per month. However, when counting only three working weeks per month, the calculation is adjusted as follows:

• 12 data points per day × 4 days per week = 48 data points per week  
• 48 data points per week × 3 weeks = 144 data points per month

Regarding repeated measures from the same dish, note that although each well is measured repeatedly over the course of the assay (baseline and after sequential substrate/inhibitor injections), these repeated readings are part of a single assay run and are used to generate one single endpoint per condition. Therefore, they are not considered separate independent data points beyond the initial one per condition.

Thus, the estimated number of “real data points” per month is 144, and while time-course measurements are recorded, they do not contribute extra independent data points from the same dish.

However, it lacks comprehensive information on the range of volumes, specific lab ware/instruments, temperature/lighting considerations, media/buffers for dilution, decision rules for the solvent, tests of solubility, and details on the final addition to the test system. The response is partially complete and lacks clarity in addressing all aspects of the question.","The assay protocol specifies the following points regarding compound preparation and addition:

1. Volumes and labware/instruments:  
 • During the assay, small volumes are used. For example, LUHMES cells are seeded into Seahorse XFe24‐well plates using 100 µl of proliferation medium, and after 1 hour an additional 400 µl is added.  
 • For dispensing compounds, highly accurate pipetting is required – operators use multistepper pipettes to minimize variance. Although no further details (e.g. precise dispensing instruments or specialized labware) are provided, the protocol does emphasize precise, multistep pipetting as critical (Section 6.5).

2. Temperature and lighting considerations:  
 • MAS buffer – which is used for dilutions – is sterile filtered and stored at 4°C until use.  
 • For compound storage, the preferred solvent (DMSO) is kept in a lightproof, air‑tight bottle at room temperature.  
 • During assay setup, the Seahorse cartridge is rehydrated with XF Calibrant at 37°C without CO₂ (Section 6.1).

3. Media, buffers, and solvent decisions:  
 • Compounds are dissolved in 100% DMSO. The final concentration of DMSO in the assay is kept at 0.1% on the cells.  
 • The dilution medium for compounds is the MAS buffer, which is freshly supplemented with ADP and digitonin just prior to the experiment.  
 • The decision rule is to maintain low solvent (DMSO) levels so that any effects are due to the compound rather than the carrier. Problems with solubility are noted as one possible uncertainty, and the use of DMSO (stored under controlled conditions) is maintained to support compound solubility (Section 6.1 and 6.5).

4. Preparation of compound stocks:  
 • Solid/powder compounds are first dissolved in 100% DMSO.  
 • Compound stocks are aliquoted into single-use volumes (sufficient for one biological replicate) to avoid repeated freeze–thaw cycles that could impair stability and efficiency (Section 6.1).  
 • Storage conditions follow the manufacturer’s instructions (which can be 4°C, room temperature, or –20°C).

5. Dilution preparation and filtering:  
 • For each experiment, a previously aliquoted compound is thawed and then diluted in MAS buffer (which has been freshly supplemented with digitonin and ADP) to a 10× final concentration. This diluted solution contains 1% DMSO, ensuring that when added to the cells (at a 1:10 dilution during the assay), the final DMSO concentration is 0.1%.  
 • While the MAS buffer is sterile filtered when prepared, there is no mention of an additional filtering step for the compound solutions themselves (Section 6.1).

6. Final addition of test compounds to the test system:  
 • The final compound dilutions (10× concentration) are loaded into the ports of the Seahorse XF Analyzer’s hydrated cartridge.  
 • During the assay, after cells have been preincubated in MAS buffer (replacing the culture medium), the instrument automatically injects the compound from these cartridge ports into the wells.  
 • This injection occurs after the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) has been recorded—so the compound addition is precisely timed, ensuring that changes in mitochondrial complex activity are measured relative to control conditions (Section 6.1).

In summary, compounds are prepared by dissolving in 100% DMSO, aliquoted to avoid freeze–thaw cycles, and stored as recommended. Just before the assay, an aliquot is thawed and diluted 10-fold in MAS buffer (supplemented with digitonin and ADP), yielding a final DMSO level of 0.1% upon injection via the Seahorse cartridge injection system. Dispensing is done under controlled temperature conditions (MAS buffer stored at 4°C; cartridge rehydrated at 37°C), and highly accurate multistep pipetting is employed to ensure reproducibility. No additional filtering of compound solutions is indicated beyond the sterile filtration of the MAS buffer.

For each experiment, the following procedures are applied:

• According to section 6.2, the experimental procedures are noted manually in a paper lab book. In addition, all plate maps—that is, the arrangements of conditions across the wells—are pre‐defined before each experiment and then documented as part of the experiment’s metadata. These metadata files, along with the plate maps, are stored on the work group server.

• Before any experiment, compound concentrations and dilutions are calculated (using defined procedures, often with spreadsheets) and these calculations are documented in the lab book along with the experimental setup. This ensures that every step regarding the preparation and addition of test compounds is fully recorded.

• Additionally, a more detailed protocol is available as an SOP that covers all these aspects. Although the detailed SOP is not described further in the provided document (section 6.6 states “n.d.”), it is mentioned that the SOP is available in a lab-internal format and can be provided in DB-ALM format (with the link referenced in section 6.6). This SOP would normally include templates and detailed instructions for calculating concentrations, setting up experiments, and defining plate maps.

Thus, the lab-specific procedures combine pre-definition of plate maps recorded electronically as metadata, manual documentation in a paper lab book of the critical steps (including compound calculations), and a comprehensive, lab-internal SOP (formatted in DB-ALM when available) detailing all these procedures.

Routine procedures require that all intermediate steps—including any potential mistakes, uncertainties, or errors (for example, pipetting twice in one well)—are documented immediately in the paper lab book. Any deviation from the defined plate map (such as re-pipetting a well, misplacement in routine operations, or other noted errors) is entered into the lab book and marked on the plate map for that experiment. Furthermore, a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP), preferably in DB-ALM format (as referenced in section 6.6), is expected to include these documentation steps along with instructions for compound dilutions, timing, and sequential pipetting patterns.

However, it lacks clarity and completeness regarding the definition of starting dilutions, how test concentrations are defined for functional endpoints, and does not mention any SOP or DB-ALM format details.","The assay does not use a single fixed dilution scheme. Instead, six conditions (i.e. concentrations) are assessed per plate set, and the dilution steps are adjusted based on the compound’s potency. In practice, the dilution factor can range from 1:2 up to 1:10 (Section 6.4 of MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf). There is no fixed rule provided for choosing the starting concentration; the investigator defines the starting dilution based on the expected compound potency, and this should be detailed in the SOP (with DB‑ALM formatting ideally referenced in section 6.6, which currently notes “n.d.”). Similarly, for functional endpoints that do not yield a full concentration–response curve (for example, when using an EC10 from viability data as a reference for gene expression endpoints), the test concentration is typically chosen based on prior experiments; however, the protocol does not provide specific guidance on this decision, again recommending that such detailed instructions be included in the SOP.

Cell seeding and medium change should be performed as fast as possible to keep cells as short as possible at room temperature. Furthermore, only 2 wells should be aspirated and refilled at once on day 3. The more practice an operator has, the faster the critical steps can be performed.  The cartridge should not be set down harshly, since this can lead to premature injection of compounds into the calibrant solution and, therefore, a decreased final concentration on the cells",High,"The answer fully addresses the question by identifying problematic compounds (low solubility), critical handling steps (use of multistepper pipette, cell seeding, and medium change), and robustness issues (operator training and handling of the cartridge). It also describes potential pitfalls, such as premature injection of compounds. The response is relevant and complete.","Compounds in this assay can be problematic if they have low solubility in the stock or dilution solvent. For example, if a compound does not dissolve well in 100% DMSO—which is used to prepare stocks—and then faces further dilution in MAS buffer (with a final DMSO concentration of 0.1%), precipitation or loss of compound activity may occur (Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf, Section 6.5). Although the document does not specifically mention fluorescent properties interfering with the analytical endpoint, it does emphasize that precise handling is essential to avoid technical artefacts, implying that any compound introducing additional variability could be problematic.

Critical handling steps include:  
• Ensuring high-quality, consistent pipetting. The assay requires use of a multistep pipette and very experienced operators to minimize variance during compound preparation and medium exchange.  
• Keeping cell seeding and medium changes as short as possible at room temperature to prevent cell stress. Operators are advised to process only two wells at a time on day 3, minimizing room‐temperature exposure (Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf, Section 6.5).  
• Handling the Seahorse cartridge with care. The cartridge must not be set down harshly to avoid premature injection of compounds into the calibrant solution, which leads to decreased final concentrations on the cells.

Other robustness issues include variability introduced by differences in plastic ware (where inappropriate supplier lots or changes can cause uneven coating leading to cell clumping or aggregation) and variability in cell behavior due to passage number or issues with the cell batch. In short, low compound solubility, the need for impeccable pipetting and rapid handling, and sensitivity to consumables (like coated plates and correct cell density) are the main potential pitfalls, and operator mistakes in these areas can compromise assay performance (Sources: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf, Sections 3.5, 6.5).",0.755603070412937,0.3643549382686615,0.099260613322258,0.2214919924736023

1. UKN3a assay (DB‐ALM protocol no. 202) – This assay assesses compound‐induced neurite integrity impairment in human mature dopaminergic neurons after long‐term compound exposure. In contrast to the present MCL assay, which focuses on mitochondrial complex activity in proliferating LUHMES cells, UKN3a is designed to monitor structural and integrity changes of neurites in more differentiated neurons.

2. UKN3b assay (DB‐ALM protocol no. 196) – Similar to UKN3a, this assay examines neurite integrity in mature dopaminergic neurons. The present method differs by targeting mitochondrial respiratory measure endpoints rather than neurite outgrowth.

3. UKN4 (NeuriTox) assay – This serves as a pre‐screening tool for compound‐induced impairment of neurite outgrowth. While UKN4 is geared to identify neurotoxicants based on neurite changes, the MCL assay specifically quantifies inhibition of individual mitochondrial complexes.

4. UKN4b (MitoMet) assay – Also a pre‐screening assay, it is optimized to detect mitochondrial toxicants by assessing neurite outgrowth with increased sensitivity. Again, unlike the MCL assay, which directly measures mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates (OCR) associated with individual complexes using a Seahorse analyzer, UKN4b correlates neurite effects with mitochondrial perturbations.

5. MSL: Seahorse MitoStress Test – This assay uses day‑3 LUHMES cells for measuring compound‐induced changes in mitochondrial respiratory parameters (for example, under glucose or galactose conditions). Its readout is based on a global mitochondrial stress profile rather than the selective, complex‐specific assessment performed in the present MCL assay.

Regarding alternative endpoints, there is no indication that the current test method has been used for high throughput transcriptomics or deep sequencing.

1. Raw Data Format – The Seahorse XF Analyzer generates the raw data as a Wave Assay Result (.asyr) file, which contains both the raw oxygen and pH measurements along with associated metadata. Although the .asyr is a proprietary format, the data are typically exported (e.g., into Excel) for further processing. This export includes time‐stamped readings and measurement channels (e.g. oxygen concentration, OCR) recorded during the assay.

2. Processed Data – After export, the raw data are normalized and processed to allow simple comparison across different experiments and endpoints. In the MCL assay, the first OCR measurement right after the injection of a substrate or inhibitor is compared to the pre-injection (basal) value. In the Excel output, the processed data are often presented as percentages of the control, allowing clear identification of inhibited complex activities across conditions.

However, it lacks clarity and completeness in describing all processing steps, such as background correction and detailed normalization procedures. Additionally, it does not mention how summary data like EC50 or BMC15 are specifically obtained.","Raw data processing in our lab follows several well‐defined steps. First, the Seahorse XF Analyzer records oxygen levels (and pH) to calculate readouts such as the oxygen consumption rate (OCR). These values, along with the metadata, are saved in a .asyr file (Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf, Section 7.1).

Next, artefacts and technical outliers are identified and excluded from the dataset (Source: Section 7.2). In our background correction, all individual OCR values are normalized to the last measurement taken immediately before the injection of any compound. This step essentially subtracts the baseline “background” signal measured in the medium control from the subsequent measurements (Source: Section 7.3).

For normalization, the processing entails:
• Exporting the Seahorse XF Analyzer data (OCR values and corresponding metadata) into Excel.
• Normalizing each OCR measurement by dividing the first value recorded after the selective substrate feeding by the average of the corresponding untreated (solvent control; 0.1% DMSO) wells. In this way, the complex’s activity is expressed as a percentage relative to the control (Source: Section 7.3).

Once the normalized data are obtained, curve fitting is performed using Excel and GraphPad Prism to construct dose–response curves (e.g., fitting with a 4‑parameter logistic equation). Nonlinear regression is used to calculate parameters such as EC50. If a nonlinear fit is not possible, a linear curve is fitted. Additionally, benchmark concentration (BMC) values, together with their upper (BMCU) and lower (BMCL) confidence intervals, are computed using the online BMCeasy software (Source: Section 7.4).

Thus, the complete workflow is as follows:
1. Data collection by the Seahorse XF Analyzer with embedded metadata.
2. Exclusion of artefacts/outliers and background correction by normalizing to the last pre-injection measurement.
3. Exporting data into Excel, then normalizing the post-injection OCR values to the average of untreated controls (expressing complex activity in % of control).
4. Curve fitting using GraphPad Prism (or Excel) to derive dose–response parameters such as EC50 and further derivation of BMC values via BMCeasy.

"How are data normally handled to obtain the overall test result (e.g. concentration response fitting using model X, determination of EC50 by method Y, use of EC50 as final data)? How do you model your concentration response curve (e.g. LL.4 parameter fit) and which software do you use (e.g. GraphPad Prism, R, etc.)? Do you usually calculate an uncertainty measure of your summary data (e.g. a 95% confidence interval for the BMC or a BMCL), and with which software? Can you give uncertainty for non-cytotoxicity or no-effect? How do you handle non-monotonic curve shapes or other curve features that are hard to describe with the usual mathematical fit model?","The data are analyzed with Excel and represented with GraphPad Prism. For the concentration curve, a nonlinear regression fit is calculated. The fitting method is least squares. If a non-linear curve fit is not possible, a linear curve fit is performed. The curve deriving from the fit is a 4-parameter log function. Treated concentrations are analyzed for deviation from control. Sometimes it is analyzed whether the deviation of neurite growth is different from the deviation of viability. This is done by two-way ANOVA + Tukey-Kramer post hoc testing. Statistics applied are one-way ANOVA (and nonparametric) with Dunnett’s post test. BMC values with their upper and lower confidence intervals (BMCU and BMCL) are calculated via the publically available online software: http://invitrotox.uni-konstanz.de/BMCeasy/",Medium,"The answer provides some details on data handling, such as using Excel and GraphPad Prism for analysis and a nonlinear regression fit for concentration curves. It mentions the use of a 4-parameter log function and statistical tests like ANOVA. However, it lacks clarity on how non-monotonic curves are handled and does not explicitly address uncertainty measures for non-cytotoxicity or no-effect. The mention of BMC values and confidence intervals is relevant but not fully detailed.","The raw data (OCR values) are first normalized—each value is divided by the last measurement before compound injection. The normalized data are then exported from the Seahorse Analyzer into Excel and subsequently analyzed using GraphPad Prism. In Prism a nonlinear regression (least‑squares based) is applied, most often using a four‑parameter log (4‑PL) function. If a proper nonlinear fit cannot be achieved, a linear fit is performed as an alternative. For some endpoints, additional statistical tests (for example, one- or two-way ANOVA with appropriate post hoc tests) are used to compare treated concentrations with controls.

Furthermore, benchmark concentration (BMC) values are determined along with their upper and lower confidence intervals (BMCU and BMCL) using an online software tool (BMCeasy), which effectively provides an uncertainty measure (e.g. a 95% confidence interval). In cases where cells show no cytotoxicity or no effect (or when curve shapes are non‐monotonic and hard to fit with the usual models), then the data are analyzed for deviations from control—if the standard nonlinear model does not properly describe the data, a linear fit may be applied, and the deviations are then assessed statistically. This approach helps to flag when the classical 4‑parameter logistic model does not capture the curve type, so that the data can be interpreted with caution.

2. In addition, essential experimental details such as plate maps, compound concentrations, and dilution calculations are defined prior to the experiment and documented. These details are recorded in two ways:
  • Manually in a paper lab book, where the experimenter logs procedural steps, deviations, and any seeding errors.
  • Electronically by storing the plate maps and experiment metadata on the work group server. _(Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf, Sections 6.2 and 7.5)_

By measuring oxygen consumption (OCR) linked to individual mitochondrial complexes (I–IV), the assay reflects a key biochemical process—cellular energy metabolism—which is critical for neuronal function. Since mitochondrial dysfunction is a known key event in neurodegenerative disorders, particularly in Parkinson‐related pathology affecting nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, the assay data can be linked to adverse outcomes such as neurodegeneration with parkinsonian motor deficits. In short, the assay models mitochondrial bioenergetics and its impairment (e.g., through complex inhibition or uncoupling), which can lead to toxic events like oxidative stress and subsequent cell death. Thus, the method potentially predicts hazards linked to mitochondrial toxicants in the central nervous system.

The response is incomplete and does not cover the required aspects of the question.","Below is a summary of the prediction model and its thresholds as described in the EFSA NAMs case study document for the MCL assay (Sources: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf – Sections 8.2 and 8.3):

1. For dichotomized data:
 • The model considers a mitochondrial complex “inhibited” if its measured activity (normalized to baseline) decreases by more than 2× the standard deviation (2×SD) of the baseline variation. For complex I, an increase (i.e. uncoupling) beyond 2×SD is also noted.
 • In a dichotomized outcome, if the effect is beyond the ±2×SD threshold the result is labeled toxic (or indicative of an effect on that complex); if the effect remains within 2×SD of the baseline then the result is considered not toxic.

2. For pseudo-dichotomized outcomes (with a borderline class):
 • The borderline range can be defined as the range of responses that do not exceed the ±2×SD threshold. In other words, any change within ±2×SD of the baseline is regarded as borderline (or normal variation), whereas changes beyond this range are classified as clearly “toxic” (or indicative of complex inhibition/uncoupling).

3. For multi‑class or continuous outcomes:
 • The response is expressed as a percentage of the control (basal OCR normalized to the last measurement prior to compound injection).
 • The threshold is mathematically defined: a change exceeding 2×SD from the baseline (either as inhibition or as hyperactivity in the case of cI uncoupling) is considered clearly significant.
 • Rationale: A 2×SD threshold is used because it represents a statistically significant deviation from the baseline variation, meaning that any effect beyond this cut‐off is unlikely to be due to inherent measurement noise. This approach is based on an objective, mathematical criterion. Biologically, a marked change in the function of mitochondrial complexes (reflected as >2×SD deviation) is likely to alter cellular metabolism and is therefore of toxicological relevance.

Additional points on toxicological rationale, limitations, and screening hit definition:
 • Toxicological Rationale: Although the threshold is based on a mathematical criterion (2×SD), it also has biological meaning because the mitochondrial complexes are critical in maintaining cellular energy metabolism. A significant deviation suggests a functional impairment that can be linked to adverse outcomes.
 • Limitations: The model is reliant on the baseline variation being stable and representative. In cases where the baseline variability is high (or fluctuates due to technical or biological reasons), the 2×SD threshold may miss subtle yet biologically relevant changes or conversely flag minor deviations as toxic effects. Moreover, the assay only evaluates mitochondrial complex activity and may not capture other aspects of mitochondrial or cellular toxicity.
 • Screening (Hit) Definition: In screening mode, a “hit” is defined as any compound that causes a change in the measured activity of any of the four mitochondrial complexes (or uncoupling in the case of cI) beyond the 2×SD threshold compared to controls. This means that any compound producing a statistically significant deviation from the baseline (per the described criteria) will be flagged as a potential toxicant needing further evaluation.

• There is no information that a z‑factor has been determined. (Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf)

• Specificity of the method is based on the selective detection of inhibition of each mitochondrial complex. This is evidenced by the use of complex‐specific substrates paired with known inhibitors (e.g. rotenone for cI, malonate for cII, antimycin A for cIII, and sodium azide for cIV) and by the observation that compounds affecting other cellular components (e.g. cytoskeletal toxicants) do not elicit a response. Thus, specificity is assessed by comparing the responses to these well‐characterized inhibitors versus non‑mitochondrial acting agents.

It lacks information on how the test reacts to mixtures and UVCBs, areas to be excluded or suitable for testing, undetectable compound classes, and compounds that may interfere with the test system.","Based on the document:

1. The assay is designed to detect compounds that exert their toxicity by inhibiting the mitochondrial respiratory‐chain complexes. In practice, it reliably picks up mitochondrial toxicants—that is, substances that directly impair complex I, II, III, or IV activity. In contrast, it is unlikely to register compounds that work via other modes of action. For example, cytoskeletal toxicants have been noted to have no significant effect on the readout (see section 8.6, “Applicability of test method,” and section 5.8).

2. The documentation does not provide any specific information on how mixtures or UVCBs behave in this assay. No dedicated performance data or interpretation guidelines for mixtures/UVCBs are described (information not found in documents).

3. In terms of the kinds of compounds that are particularly suitable, the assay is tailored to chemicals whose toxicity is mediated through altered mitochondrial complex activity. It is optimized for compounds that can be solubilized (using DMSO, with a final concentration of 0.1%) and that interact directly with mitochondrial targets. Conversely, compounds acting via other pathways (for example, endocrine disruptors that need a specific receptor pathway or certain neurotransmitters where the respective receptors are not expressed in these LUHMES cells) would not be expected to yield any effect through this test (see sections 5.2 and 8.6).

4. In short, a compound class that cannot be detected effectively would be those that do not affect mitochondrial function—such as endocrine disruptors lacking a mitochondrial mechanism or neurotransmitters that require receptors not present in this assay’s LUHMES cells.

5. Finally, the documents do not report any examples of chemicals with intrinsic fluorescence or coloration that interfere with the oxygen consumption measurements using the Seahorse XF Analyzer. That said, as with any assay relying on optical or metabolic readouts, test compounds with strongly fluorescent or colored properties might in principle complicate the analysis, but no specific interference is noted in the provided documentation (see section 6.1 regarding compound handling).

Should the test preferentially be used in the first tier or later tiers, are complementary assays required or is it a stand-alone method?",Strengths: - Internal controls to exclude artefacts easily - Mechanistic information,Low,"The answer does not address the question about whether the test fits into a test battery, nor does it specify which test battery it might fit into or any restrictions. It only lists strengths without discussing performance compared to similar tests, gaps it fills, or its tier preference in a test battery.","The assay is designed to be one element in a broader neurotoxicity battery. It fills a gap by providing a mechanistic read‐out of mitochondrial complex inhibition (for complexes I–IV) that is not captured by assays focusing only on viability or neurite integrity. In a battery it can serve as a confirmation/ mechanistic follow‐up test to “de‐risk” alerts from screening assays and help clarify the mode of action (e.g. whether a compound impairs mitochondrial function via a specific complex). 

Key points include:  
• It brings mechanistic information (by distinguishing between inhibition of individual mitochondrial complexes) that supplements outcomes from related assays (such as neurite outgrowth or general mitochondrial stress assays).  
• Its internal controls allow the exclusion of artefacts (for example, verifying that oxygen consumption rate [OCR] does not change in negative controls), which is a strength compared to less precise or non‐mechanistic tests.  
• However, because it requires specialized instrumentation (a Seahorse XF Analyzer) and well‐trained operators, the throughput is lower than simpler screening assays; furthermore, the method has not been formally validated in multi‐lab ring trials yet.  
• Thus, in a potential test battery the method is best employed as a tier‐2 tool to follow up screening alerts—either as a stand‐alone mechanistic assessment for mitochondrial perturbation or as a complementary assay together with others (for example, assays for neurite integrity or viability).  

In summary, the assay fits into a neurotoxicity test battery by addressing mitochondrial dysfunction as a key event (for example, the AOP linking mitochondrial complex I inhibition to parkinsonian deficits). Its strengths (mechanistic clarity, built‐in controls) make it highly suitable for confirmation or mechanistic follow‑up, while its technical demands and specialization suggest it should not be used as a first‐tier screening assay by itself. Complementary assays (for endpoints such as neurite outgrowth, general viability, etc.) remain necessary as part of an integrated battery.

There is no prioritization or comments on the type of information obtained from these publications, which are key components of the question.","Below is a concise answer based strictly on the provided document (MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf):

1. Deviations from Published Descriptions  
 • Plastic Plate Supplier and Coating: Although published versions use coated plastic ware, our procedure explicitly recommends a coating with a poly‐L‐ornithine (43 µg/ml) and fibronectin (1 µg/ml) solution. We note that plates from different suppliers “have occurred in the past” to cause cell clumping and aggregation (see sections 3.7 and 3.5). Thus, if the plastic ware supplier changes relative to the published description, deviations in cell distribution may occur.  
 • Cell Number and Seeding Timing: In our protocol, seeding is done either 1 day prior (60,000 cells per well) or 2 days prior (40,000 cells per well) to the assay (section 4.1). Some published protocols on LUHMES cells use different numbers or timing. In our method the details (e.g. 1 h attachment prior to adding 400 µl medium) have been optimized and may differ from earlier descriptions.  
 • Endpoint Measurement: Our assay determines mitochondrial complex activities from the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measured with a Seahorse XF Analyzer. OCR values are normalized to the last measurement before compound injection and then compared to controls (section 5.3). Some published methods might normalize differently or use alternative parameters for comparing OCRs.  
 • Timing of Steps: Specific steps (e.g. immediate rehydration of the cartridge 1 day prior to the experiment and very short handling times during critical medium changes) are noted to reduce cell stress. Such details, although based on prior publications, have been refined in our current protocol and can deviate from older published descriptions.  
 • Test System Status: In our assay the LUHMES cells are used in the proliferative precursor stage. This contrasts with some published approaches that use more differentiated cells, which could affect endpoints and sensitivity (sections 4 and 8).

2. Most Relevant Publications Describing the Test System and/or Method  
 (a) Test System – LUHMES cells:  
  • Scholz et al. (2011), “Rapid, complete and large-scale generation of post-mitotic neurons from the human LUHMES cell line”  
   – This publication gives a comprehensive overview of the LUHMES cell source, differentiation characteristics, and basic cell handling. It covers the creation of post-mitotic neurons, marker expression (e.g. bIII-tubulin, Fox-3/NeuN) and growth characteristics.  
  • Lotharius et al. (2005), “Progressive degeneration of human mesencephalic neuron-derived cells triggered by dopamine-dependent oxidative stress…”  
   – Although older, it offers background on the dopaminergic phenotype and mitochondrial relevance of LUHMES cells.  

 (b) Test Method – Mitochondrial Complex Activity Measurement:  
  • Delp et al. (2019), “Development of a neurotoxicity assay that is tuned to detect mitochondrial toxicants”  
   – This key publication provides details on the assay setup, including the sequential injection of substrates and inhibitors to assess cI–cIV activity. It covers methodological aspects such as cell permeabilization, OCR measurement, and normalization approaches.  

3. Prioritized List of Further Publications  
 1. Delp et al. (2019) – The high priority publication since it directly describes the test method, the use of the Seahorse XF analyzer, and the overall approach to detect mitochondrial toxicants.  
  • Information provided: Detailed assay protocol, standard chemical inhibitors (rotenone, malonate, antimycin A, sodium azide), and normalization of OCR endpoints.  
 2. Scholz et al. (2011) – Provides an in-depth overview of the LUHMES cell line, including differentiation ability and validation of the dopaminergic phenotype.  
  • Information provided: Cell source description, differentiation procedure, and baseline criteria for cell health and network formation.  
 3. Gutbier et al. (2018), “Major changes of cell function and toxicant sensitivity in cultured cells undergoing mild, quasi‑natural genetic drift.”  
  • Information provided: Insights into variability in cell behavior with passage number and how different culture conditions may affect assay performance, including positive/negative controls and sensitivity to toxicants.  
 4. Delp et al. (2021) – Follow-up publication that expands the application of the assay and validates it with additional compounds.  
  • Information provided: Extended test chemical lists, additional positive/negative controls, and cross-validation with other neurotoxicity tests.  

Each of these publications contributes different types of information:  
 – Some (e.g. Delp et al. 2019 and 2021) document the test chemical lists, provide methodological validation against other tests, and demonstrate integration into a test battery.  
 – Others (e.g., Scholz et al. 2011) give a more comprehensive description of the test system including cell lineage and differentiation, while Gutbier et al. (2018) provides insights into reproducibility and variability issues that are relevant for troubleshooting and standardization.

Are of human origin, form network b) A formal mechanistic validation has not been performed. c) The test covers a fundamental cellular process.",Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by mentioning that LUHMES are dopaminergic and of human origin, which is relevant to the system reflecting human biology. However, it lacks clarity and completeness as it does not provide detailed information on mechanistic validation or how well the system reflects specific human biological processes related to the form of toxicity being assessed. The mention of a lack of formal mechanistic validation further indicates incompleteness.","The documentation indicates that mechanistic validation is addressed by using endpoint‐specific control compounds (MCC) to confirm assay responsiveness. For example, section 5.5 lists specific control compounds—including rotenone for complex I, malonate for complex II, antimycin A for complex III, and sodium azide for complex IV—as analytical tools to distinguish the activity of individual mitochondrial complexes, and FCCP is used as an uncoupler. However, although these controls help verify that the assay can detect complex‐specific inhibition, a formal mechanistic validation (for instance via omics approaches) has not been performed (section 9.3, also section 4.6 is noted as “n.d.” for omics characterization). 

In terms of reflecting human biology relevant to the toxicity being assessed, the assay uses human LUHMES cells that are dopaminergic, express markers such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and form neuronal networks, which is pertinent for modeling nigrostriatal neurons. This supports the assay’s relevance for evaluating mitochondrial toxicants in a human neuronal context.

No further details on exposure scenarios beyond standard safe handling procedures are available in the provided context _(Source: MitoComplexesLUHMESassay(MCL).pdf, Sections 11.1–11.2)_.",0.5943548131391523,0.5863926410675049,-0.18368099629878998,0.08855978399515152
"Are special permits (e.g. genetic work, stem cells, radioactivity, etc.) required? Are special facilities required? Is special ethical approval necessary (indicate approval document).",Work requires S1 cell culture laboratories (genetically modified cells). No specific facilities are required. No specific ethical approval is required.,Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by mentioning the requirement for S1 cell culture laboratories and stating that no specific facilities or ethical approval are required. However, it lacks clarity on whether any special permits are needed for the genetic work itself, which is part of the question.","The assay does not require additional permits (e.g. for genetic work, stem cells, or radioactivity) beyond what is normally needed for S1 cell culture work with genetically modified cells. Special facilities are not required apart from a standard S1 cell culture laboratory and no specific ethical approval or approval document is necessary.
