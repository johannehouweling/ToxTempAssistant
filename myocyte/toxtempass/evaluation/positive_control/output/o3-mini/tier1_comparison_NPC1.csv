Please describe in no more than 200 words the following:,,,,"The NPC1 assay is an in vitro methodology designed to assess developmental neurotoxicity by measuring human neural progenitor cell (hNPC) proliferation. Human fetal hNPCs, derived from the cortex (gestation weeks 16–19), are cultured as three-dimensional neurospheres. In this assay, a single neurosphere of approximately 300 µm in diameter is plated per well in poly‑HEMA coated 96‑well plates filled with proliferation medium supplemented with growth factors EGF and FGF. Over a period of 72 hours, proliferation is monitored by two primary endpoints: the increase in sphere area (NPC1a) and DNA synthesis measured via BrdU incorporation (NPC1b). Secondary endpoints include measurements of cytotoxicity and viability. The assay mimics in vivo fetal brain development, reflecting critical processes of neural growth. It uses a series of controls, including growth factor withdrawal to demonstrate a reduction in cell proliferation, and employs statistical models for hit classification based on concentration-response relationships. This method is part of an in vitro DNT battery and is supported by detailed protocols and validation studies (Sources: NPC1.pdf).",0.031679999676211906,-1.0699931383132935,-1.07051682472229,-1.0619372129440308

• The cells must be provided with a cell count of approximately 1 × 10^6 cells per vial (with a concentration around 1.2 × 10^6 cells/mL) and a viability of at least 20%.  
• They are required to be pathogen‐free; that is, they must test negative for HIV, HBV, “HC” (i.e. hepatitis viruses), sterility (no bacterial contamination), and mycoplasma.  
• In terms of phenotype, the expanded neurospheres must express the neural stem/progenitor cell markers nestin, SOX2, and Ki67 (indicating proliferation) and, after differentiation, positive staining for markers such as TUBB3 and GFAP must be confirmed.  
• Functionally, the cells must respond appropriately to growth factor stimuli (EGF and FGF) such that stimulation increases proliferation and their removal (or pharmacological inhibition of EGFR) diminishes this response.

In the 3- to 4-week expansion period different donors can show differences in their proliferative capacity (spheres need longer, 3 instead of 4 weeks, to reach the acceptable minimum size of 0.2 – 0.5 µm). After the first mechanical dissociation, there are no observable or measurable inter-individual differences. Critical consumables The proliferation medium does not contain serum or serum replacement. The use of EGF and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is critical for sphere growth. FGF contains 1% bovine serum albumin and is thus prone to batch effects. Critical handling The thawing medium contains DMSO in a concentration that affects cell health which is why thawed cells should quickly be diluted in proliferation medium (30 mL of media for one vial of cells). It is recommended to add FGF to the proliferation medium directly before thawing. At the end of week two of the expansion period (see below), the spheres should be transferred to petri dishes coated with poly-(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly-Hema) to prevent cell attachment. Attached cells that are not differentiated can be gently detached using a 1000 µL pipet. To avoid repeated attachment, all cells should be transferred to a new poly-Hema coated petri dish. Medium containing FGF should not be stored longer than 1 week at 4°C. During the first two weeks, the medium should be removed using a 1000 µL pipet to keep the accidental removal of small spheres to a minimum. In addition, removed medium should be kept in a new petri dish under culture conditions until the next feeding day, to transfer accidentally removed spheres back to the culture. The neurospheres should be well distributed in the petri dish to prevent aggregation. This is especially important after mechanical dissociations. It is important to avoid frequent re-opening of the incubators, to ensure constant CO2 and temperature levels. Furthermore, the smallest vibrations can lead to aggregations of neurospheres. The number of passages after thawing influences the proliferation capability of neurospheres. Neurospheres should not be used for the NPC1 assay after passage 6.",Medium,"The answer provides some relevant information about variability in initial cells, critical consumables, and handling steps, such as the importance of EGF and FGF, and handling procedures to prevent cell attachment. However, it lacks comprehensive coverage of all aspects mentioned in the question, such as specific batch effects, detailed handling steps, and recommendations for genetically-modified cells and microphysiological systems. The recommendations for reproducibility and performance are also not fully addressed.","The test system documentation highlights several factors that can contribute to variability in the source cells and emphasizes critical consumables and handling steps to improve reproducibility. For example:

1. Variability in the initial cells/source cells arises from donor‐dependent differences. The sphere size at day 0 (after thawing) can vary with the donor, and during the expansion period, different donors may require a longer (or shorter) time to reach the acceptable sphere size (0.2–0.5 mm). In addition, the passage number (with the recommendation not to exceed passage 6) influences the proliferation capability. (Source: NPC1.pdf, pages 102–103)

2. Critical consumables include:
 • Growth factors: EGF and recombinant human FGF are essential for sphere growth. FGF is prepared with 1% bovine serum albumin, and this additive is prone to batch effects.
 • Plate coating reagents: The use of poly‐Hema coated dishes is required to prevent attachment and aggregation of neurospheres.
 • Note that the proliferation medium does not contain serum or serum replacement, so the correct preparation of additives is critical. (Source: NPC1.pdf, pages 103)

3. Critical handling steps and influencing factors include:
 • Thawing: The thawing medium contains DMSO, which is detrimental if not removed quickly; hence cells should be diluted rapidly in proliferation medium.
 • Pipetting: Gentle pipetting is needed to avoid detaching or loss of small spheres, and the use of consistent volumes (e.g., using a standardized 1,000 µL pipet) can help maintain reproducibility.
 • Medium exchange: When changing the medium (especially during the first two weeks), care must be taken to avoid the accidental removal of small spheres. The removed medium should be saved and returned to the culture.
 • Incubator stability: Avoid frequent re‐opening or vibrations in the incubator, as these can disturb the spheres and lead to aggregation or variable growth.
 • Consistency in mechanical dissociation for passaging is required to yield uniform sphere sizes.
( Source: NPC1.pdf, pages 103–105)

4. For cells with additional modifications (e.g. genetically modified cells or in microphysiological systems), one must also consider factors such as:
 • Matrix chemistry and geometry: For microphysiological systems, the choice and consistency of the matrix (or plate coating) become even more critical.
 • Microfluidics: Systems using microfluidics require precise control of flow and cell distribution, with special attention to differences between surface versus core cell responses.
( These considerations are analogous to the critical handling related to cell–matrix interactions discussed in NPC1.pdf and should be integrated when working with modified systems.)

5. Recommendations to increase reproducibility and performance include:
 • Standardize donor selection and use cells within the recommended passage range.
 • Use automation (e.g. liquid handling systems) for pipetting steps, compound dilutions, and assays to minimize user bias.
 • Always prepare FGF freshly (or add it directly to the medium before thawing) to mitigate batch effects.
 • Employ careful recording and adherence to SOPs (as provided in NPC1.pdf) to document every step (e.g. medium change, passaging, and plating), ensuring traceability.
 • Where possible, use standardized plates and coating reagents (e.g., poly‐Hema) to avoid variations due to different suppliers or plate formats.

In summary, by controlling donor-related variability, using critical consumables with minimal batch-to-batch variation, and standardizing rapid and careful handling steps, the reproducibility and performance of the assay can be significantly improved.",0.7915676323752924,0.16639868915081024,0.009263336658477783,0.08621262013912201
"Describe the principles of the selected differentiation protocol, including a scheme and graphical overview, indicating all phases, media, substrates, manipulation steps (medium change/re-plating, medium additives, etc.). Special/additional requirements apply to microphysiological systems and organoids: e.g. cell printing, self-aggregation/self-organisation process, interaction with the matrix, geometrical characterization (size/shape), etc.","Cells are frozen in liquid nitrogen and have to be cultivated in proliferation medium at 37°C and 5% CO2 after thawing. The medium contains Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium and Hams F12 (2:1) supplemented with 2% B27, 20 ng/mL EGF, 20 ng/mL recombinant human FGF, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. The thawing is performed by repeated addition and removal of proliferation medium to the vial until all cells are transferred to a tissue culture flask containing proliferation medium. The cells are carefully resuspended and distributed to 10 cm petri dishes filled with fresh, prewarmed proliferation medium. The cells are fed by replacing half the medium with new medium every two to three days (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). At each feeding day, the culture is checked for impurities (e.g. fibers or other debris). Impurities and the removed media are transferred to a new petri dish (waste dish). If spheres are mistakenly sorted out during feeding, they can be rescued and placed back in the original culture dish. After 3-4 weeks, neurospheres reach the acceptable size of 0.2 – 0.5 mm for passaging by mechanical dissociation. Therefore, neurospheres are mechanically dissociated into pieces of 0.15 - 0.25 mm edge length (depending on the desired sphere size after passaging) using a tissue chopper, which then round-off again to uniform sized neurospheres within 1 day in proliferation medium. By using this method, neurospheres are expanded every week. Starting at week 2, poly-Hema coated dishes are used for the cultivation procedure. Figure 1 differentiation towards the final test system. hNPC are thawed by repeated addition and removal of proliferation media. The resuspended cells are distributed to cell culture dishes and cultivated in proliferation media containing EGF and FGF for three to four weeks with 50% media exchange every two to three days.

However, it lacks a graphical overview and does not fully address all phases of the differentiation protocol, such as specific manipulation steps or additional requirements for microphysiological systems and organoids. The answer is missing details on cell printing, self-aggregation, interaction with the matrix, and geometrical characterization.","The differentiation protocol transforms cryopreserved primary hNPCs into self‐organized, three‐dimensional neurospheres with defined size and shape, following these principles (Source: NPC1.pdf):

1. Initial Thawing and Expansion:  
 • Cells are thawed by repeatedly adding and removing proliferation medium.  
 • hNPCs are then transferred into prewarmed proliferation medium (a mixture of DMEM and Ham’s F12 in a 2:1 ratio, supplemented with 2% B27, 20 ng/mL EGF, 20 ng/mL FGF, and antibiotics).  
 • They are plated in standard 10 cm dishes and fed every 2–3 days by replacing half of the medium to support growth.

2. Formation of Neurospheres via Self‑aggregation:  
 • Over a period of 3–4 weeks, the cells expand and aggregate as free‑floating neurospheres exhibiting a perfectly round shape and defined borders.  
 • These spheres naturally self‐organize in suspension, reflecting key aspects of fetal neural tissue architecture.

3. Passaging and Mechanical Dissociation:  
 • When spheres reach an acceptable size (0.2–0.5 mm), they are mechanically dissociated (using a tissue chopper) into uniformly sized fragments (0.15–0.25 mm edge length).  
 • Following dissociation, the fragments re‐round to form uniform neurospheres within one day in the same proliferation medium.

4. Use of Non-adherent Substrates to Preserve 3D Morphology:  
 • Starting in week 2, and for subsequent culturing, neurospheres are transferred onto poly‑HEMA coated dishes.  
 • This coating prevents adhesion to the matrix, thereby preserving the free‑floating, three‑dimensional configuration essential for proper self‑organization and controlled sphere geometry.

5. Final Setup in Test Conditions:  
 • For the assay, one neurosphere (ideally 0.25–0.35 mm in diameter) is plated into each well of a poly‑HEMA coated U‑bottom 96‑well plate.  
 • The assay medium continues to include EGF and FGF to stimulate proliferation.  
 • Throughout the assay (a 72‑hour exposure period), sphere size is monitored via bright‐field microscopy, while additional endpoints (BrdU incorporation, viability and cytotoxicity) are assessed at the end of the exposure.

Graphical Overview (as outlined in Figure 1 of the source):  
 – Step 1: Thawing of hNPCs by repeated media exchange.  
 – Step 2: Distribution into culture flasks for expansion in proliferation medium.  
 – Step 3: Regular feeding (50% medium exchange every 2–3 days) over 3–4 weeks until neurospheres reach 0.2–0.5 mm.  
 – Step 4: Mechanical dissociation of neurospheres into defined fragments that re‐form into spheres.  
 – Step 5: Transfer onto poly‑HEMA coated dishes to maintain non‑adherent growth and prevent unwanted cell attachment.  
 – Step 6: Plating one uniform neurosphere per well in 96‑well U‑bottom plates for the final assay, where proliferation is measured over 72 hours.

Additional notes for microphysiological systems/organoids: Although cell printing per se is not applied here, the method relies on a self‑aggregation/self‑organization process to generate defined 3D structures. The use of non-adherent substrates (poly‑HEMA) ensures that the cells maintain their spherical structure without spreading or attaching, thereby facilitating geometrical characterization (size/shape) via automated imaging. This approach supports reproducibility and a controlled microenvironment that mimics the in vivo fetal neural context.

Between one to three days after passaging, depending on the size chosen for passaging, spheres at a size of 0.3 mm are used in the assay. For the assessment of neural progenitor cell proliferation, the spheres are plated in poly-Hema coated 96- well U-bottom plates filled with proliferation medium containing growth factors (EGF and FGF). One 0.25 - 0.35 mm big sphere is plated in the middle of each well. Within 3 days NPCs proliferate and grow in size. Cultivation during the test method is performed at 37°C and 5% CO2 at a pH of 7.2-7.6. As a positive control, spheres are cultivated in absence of growth factors (EGF and FGF), which dramatically reduces proliferation.",Medium,"The answer provides some details about the culture protocol, such as the use of growth factors and the conditions for cultivation. However, it lacks information on the percentage of contaminating cells, the percentage of each subpopulation in co-cultures, and the sensitivity of subpopulations to cytotoxicity.

These neurospheres are generated by thawing and expanding the cells in a serum‑free proliferation medium that is supplemented with key growth factors—epidermal growth factor (EGF) and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor (FGF). During the expansion phase, over about 3–4 weeks, the cells are passaged weekly (using mechanical dissociation) and maintained in 3D floating culture conditions (with transfer to poly‑HEMA coated dishes from week 2 onward to prevent attachment). Prior to testing, a uniform neurosphere (around 0.25–0.35 mm in diameter) is selected and plated in a poly‑HEMA coated 96‑well U‑bottom plate, where proliferation is monitored over 72 hours by measuring sphere size (by brightfield imaging) and DNA synthesis (via BrdU incorporation).

However, it lacks detail on other potential endpoints like gene expression or staining, does not specify acceptance criteria values, and omits historical control data and actions if criteria are not met. The methods for evaluating these criteria are also not fully described.","The NPC1 assay verifies that the source hNPC‐based 3D neurospheres meet predefined morphological and molecular criteria before any test compound is added. For example, before starting a toxicity run, the assay requires that the neurospheres:

• Display a perfectly round shape with intact, non‐disintegrated borders. For instance, only neurospheres that are uniformly round and intact are accepted for plating. (Source: NPC1.pdf, “Acceptance criteria for assessing the test system at its start”)

• Have a defined size – specifically, a neurosphere of approximately 300 µm in diameter, which on average contains about 2.6×10³ cells, ensuring consistency in cell number per well. (Source: NPC1.pdf, “Acceptance criteria for assessing the test system at its start”)

In addition, prior quality control of the source cells (conducted during cell expansion) includes:
 
• Immunocytochemical confirmation that proliferating neurospheres express CNS stem/progenitor markers such as nestin, SOX2, and Ki67. This characterization ensures the cells maintain their progenitor cell identity and responsiveness to growth factors. (Source: NPC1.pdf, “Characterization and definition of source cells”)

• After differentiation (when relevant), the cells are checked for the expression of markers such as TUBB3 and GFAP to confirm their capacity to differentiate properly. (Source: NPC1.pdf, “Acceptance criteria for source cell population”)

Analytically, the assay employs:
 
• Brightfield high-content imaging for daily measurement of sphere size and morphology. The image analysis not only documents the intact and round morphology but also establishes the baseline growth rate (with an acceptance slope of 1000–3000 pixels/day for sphere area increase during a 72‑h proliferation period). (Source: NPC1.pdf, “Overview of analytical method(s) to assess test endpoint(s)”)

• Standardized protocols for handling and culturing the cells (including predetermined cell density, media composition, and growth factor supplementation) help assure that the cells are in a consistent, proliferative state prior to compound exposure. (Source: NPC1.pdf, “Differentiation towards the final test system” and “Acceptance criteria for assessing the test system at its start”)

Historical performance data in the assay have established that when the neurospheres meet these criteria their subsequent proliferation (a 33% average increase in size over 3 days) is within the expected range. In routine applications, variation measures (for example, the intra‐experimental coefficient of variation for endpoints like proliferation by area is around 19.4 ± 9.4%) confirm the robustness of the system. If one or more acceptance criteria (such as morphology, sphere size, or marker expression) are not met—for instance, if spheres are irregular, smaller than 300 µm, or if marker expression deviates from what is historically observed—the experiment is either repeated using a new batch of neurospheres or adjustments in the expansion protocol are made before proceeding with toxicity testing. (Sources: NPC1.pdf, “Acceptance criteria for assessing the test system at its start”, “Characterization and definition of source cells”, and Table 1 in NPC1.pdf)

Thus, by combining morphological assessment (via brightfield imaging) with molecular marker analysis and documented historical performance endpoints, the NPC1 assay ensures that only cultures that meet strict acceptance criteria are used for toxicity testing.",0.6944008619844974,0.21381543576717377,-0.22448818385601044,-0.04613471403717995

Over the 3 days in culture, hNPCs approximately increase their size on average by 33% (Koch et al., 2022). For this process the following acceptance criteria are defined for the solvent control containing the solvent of the highest test compound concentration (SC; mean of at least three replicates): Proliferation by area (slope of sphere area) Proliferation by BrdU (BrdU raw values): Proliferation by BrdU (BrdU raw values): 1000-3000 pixels/day raw values of treatment conditions must not be lower than the positive control raw values of the SC must be significantly higher than the positive control",Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing some acceptance criteria related to the proliferative capacity of hNPCs, including specific parameters like proliferation by area and BrdU values. However, it lacks clarity and completeness regarding other endpoints, historical controls, and specific actions if acceptance criteria are not met. The answer does not fully describe the quality criteria for cells/tissues/organoids or provide comprehensive historical control data and actions for unmet criteria.","The acceptance criteria for the NPC1 assay are defined at several levels—from the quality of the source cells to the performance of the neurosphere test system. For example, for the source cells, the cells must be obtained with a defined cell count (≥1.2×10^6 cells/mL) and a viability of at least 20% and must be free of contaminants (HIV, HBV, HC, mycoplasma, and bacteria) as well as having been confirmed positive for neuronal markers (TUBB3 and GFAP after differentiation) and neural progenitor markers (nestin, SOX2, Ki67) before use. During the differentiation and expansion, the cells are cultured into neurospheres whose quality is assessed morphologically: only perfectly round neurospheres with intact, non-disintegrated borders are acceptable. One sphere of around 300 µm diameter should contain roughly 2.6×10^3 cells.

In the assay itself (post plating for compound exposure) the endpoints are also used as quality criteria. For instance, in the solvent control the proliferative capacity must fall within established ranges: when measured by sphere area, the slope should be between 1000 and 3000 pixels/day; and for the BrdU incorporation readout, the raw luminescence values in the treatment should not drop below those of the positive control (i.e. when growth factors EGF and FGF are omitted, which markedly impairs proliferation). Historical controls (from replicate experiments run over multiple differentiations) have demonstrated that proliferating hNPCs increase their sphere size on average by about 33% over 3 days—deviations from these reference values (taking into account the observed inter‐ and intra‐experimental variation) would signal a potential problem in the test system.

If any of these acceptance criteria is not met (for example, if the neurosphere morphology is irregular, the size is far outside the 0.25–0.35 mm range, or the measured endpoints, such as the sphere area slope or BrdU readout, are outside the accepted range compared to historical controls), the experiment must be discarded and repeated following troubleshooting (e.g. re‐checking cell quality, verifying culture conditions, and ensuring proper handling of growth factors).

It mentions sources of variation related to sphere selection and biological variability but fails to discuss critical consumables, batch effects, handling steps, controls, expected values, deviations, or recommendations for reproducibility and performance.","Below is a summary of causes of variability, critical consumables/handling steps, control expectations, and recommendations to ensure reproducibility for the assay:

1. Causes of Variability in the Final Test System State:
 • The size of the hNPC spheres can differ between donors and even during expansion (different donors may require 3 versus 4 weeks to reach an acceptable size, and sphere selection (0.25–0.35 mm) can vary between researchers).  
 • Inherent heterogeneity of the 3D self‐organized neurospheres and biological variability among primary cells contribute to variability in measured endpoints.  
 (Source: NPC1.pdf, pages 102–103 and 105)

2. Critical Consumables and Batch Effects:
 • Growth factors (EGF and recombinant human FGF) are essential for sphere growth. FGF is noted to contain 1% bovine serum albumin and is prone to batch effects.  
 • The proliferation medium is serum‑free (no FCS or serum replacement), thus avoiding additional serum batch effects; however, if any additives are used, their consistency is critical.  
 • Plate formats such as poly‑Hema coated petri dishes and 96‑well U‑bottom plates are critical; using different plate types requires re‐establishment of the method.  
 (Source: NPC1.pdf, pages 103 and “Critical consumables”)

3. Critical Handling Steps and Influencing Factors:
 • Thawing: The thawing medium contains DMSO that negatively affects cell health, so cells must be rapidly diluted in proliferation medium, and FGF should be added just before thawing.  
 • Media Changes: During the early culture phase, medium removal with a 1000 µL pipet is advised to minimize loss of small spheres, and accidentally removed spheres should be recaptured by transferring the medium to a fresh dish.  
 • Passage and Aggregation: Frequent pipetting errors, vibrations, or improper cell density can lead to sphere aggregation and differentiation variability. Consistent handling (e.g., transferring spheres to new poly‑Hema dishes) is essential.  
 • Incubator conditions: Avoid frequent door openings to maintain constant CO₂ and temperature levels.  
 (Source: NPC1.pdf, pages 103–104)

4. Positive and Negative Controls:
 • Proliferation Endpoints:  
  – Positive control for proliferation is performed by omitting EGF and FGF from the medium. In this case, proliferation is expected to drop dramatically (for example, reducing the BrdU incorporation to 0–40% of that in the solvent control for the NPC1b endpoint).  
 • Viability and Cytotoxicity Endpoints:  
  – A 0.2% Triton X‑100 treatment serves as the positive control to elicit maximal cytotoxicity and viability reduction.  
 • Negative control:  
  – The solvent control (SC) is used on each plate. Established solvent concentrations (e.g., DMSO 0.1–0.3% v/v, DPBS 2% v/v, etc.) must show responses equivalent to a medium-only control.  
 • Acceptance criteria:  
  – For proliferation by sphere area (NPC1a), the slope is accepted if it is between 1000 and 3000 pixels/day.  
  – For BrdU incorporation (NPC1b), treatment conditions should not be lower than the positive control, and the SC must be significantly higher.  
  – Intra-experimental CVs (e.g., NPC1a: 19.4 ± 9.4%; NPC1b: 13.2 ± 5.9%) and inter-experimental variations (e.g., normalized inter-experimental CV of 21.4% for NPC1a and 28.1% for NPC1b) give benchmarks for expected variability.  
 (Source: NPC1.pdf, pages 105, 107, and 120)

5. Recommendations to Increase/Ensure Reproducibility and Performance:
 • Standardize sphere selection by adhering strictly to the defined size range (0.25–0.35 mm) and use mechanical dissociation consistently.  
 • Automate critical pipetting steps (preparation of dilutions, medium exchange, viability/cytotoxicity assays) using liquid handling systems to reduce human error and variability.  
 • Use the same supplier and batch for key reagents such as FGF, and monitor for batch-to-batch variability, substituting new lots only after revalidation.  
 • Ensure strict adherence to incubation conditions (37°C, 5% CO₂) and minimal disturbance to avoid sphere aggregation.  
 • Document all meta data (plating dates, cell passage, compound details) in the AXES sheet to track variability and deviations.  
 • Limit cell passage number (not using neurospheres beyond passage 6) to maintain proliferative capacity.

Give information on where the test system differs from the mimicked human tissue and which gaps of analogy need to be considered.,"hNPCs reflect the following in vivo tissue features: NPC1 – fetal NPC proliferation (3D, primary cells) corresponding to in vivo growth during the fetal phase. Proliferating hNPCs progressively increase in sphere size by on average 33% within three days of proliferation in the presence of EGF and FGF. Moreover, they express the cell type-specific CNS neural stem and progenitor cell markers nestin and SOX2 (Koch et al., 2022). EGFR signaling is indispensable for proper brain development in vivo and increasingly expressed over time (Romano and Bucci, 2020). In line with that, exposure of proliferating hNPCs to the EGFR inhibitor PD153035 impaired the proliferative capacity (Koch et al., 2022).",Medium,"The answer provides detailed information about the features of hNPCs and their relevance to in vivo tissue, but it does not explicitly address where the test system differs from the mimicked human tissue or the specific gaps of analogy that need to be considered. The focus is more on the similarities rather than the differences or gaps.","The NPC1 assay is designed to mimic fetal human cortical development by using primary neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) that proliferate as 3D spheres. However, compared with the in vivo fetal brain tissue, several gaps of analogy need to be considered:

1. Although the assay captures key features of fetal NPC proliferation (e.g., sphere growth, marker expression such as nestin and SOX2, and responsiveness to growth factors), it only represents one of several neurodevelopmental processes. The complex cellular interactions, differentiation events, and tissue architecture present in the developing brain (including neuronal migration, differentiation to multiple cell types, synaptogenesis, and network formation) are not represented in this simplified test system. (Source: NPC1.pdf)

2. The model uses a relatively homogeneous and self-organizing sphere culture derived from the human cortex. In contrast, the in vivo fetal brain consists of a heterogeneous mix of cell types, mature brain structures, vascularization, and extracellular matrix components that contribute to cell behavior and responses. This simplification may affect how well toxic effects on proliferation predict overall neurodevelopmental toxicity. (Source: NPC1.pdf)

3. Finally, while the assay provides valuable insight into the proliferative aspect of neurodevelopment (a critical process during fetal brain growth), it does not encompass other crucial in vivo processes. Thus, when interpreting data, it is important to consider that other neurodevelopmental endpoints (e.g., cell migration or network formation) require separate or complementary assays for a full hazard assessment.

This same link (and related publications) describes the procedures for routine cell culture, quality control, and batch acceptance. The key maintenance details are as follows (Sources: NPC1.pdf):

1. SOP/Database Link:  
 • The full maintenance culture protocol is available as an SOP in DB‐ALM format (Appendix I in Masjosthusmann et al., 2020).  
 • Detailed protocols are also accessible in the cited publications (e.g., Baumann et al., 2014; Nimtz et al., 2019) or upon request via ellen.fritsche@iuf-duesseldorf.de.

2. Basic Cell Propagation (Maintenance Outside the Experiment):  
 • After thawing from liquid nitrogen, hNPCs are cultured in proliferation medium (a mix of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium and Ham’s F12 [2:1] supplemented with 2% B27, 20 ng/mL EGF, 20 ng/mL recombinant human FGF, penicillin, and streptomycin) at 37°C and 5% CO₂.  
 • Cells are seeded in tissue culture flasks (or 10 cm petri dishes) and fed by replacing half the medium every two to three days.  
 • Regular mechanical dissociation and passaging (weekly) are performed once neurospheres reach a size of 0.2–0.5 mm.  

3. Cell Population Purity and Characterization:  
 • The primary human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) are supplied as 3D neurospheres from Lonza (obtained from human cortex, GW16–19).  
 • They are characterized by FACS to be positive for cell type–specific CNS markers such as nestin, SOX2, and Ki67.  
 • In addition, after differentiation, cells have been confirmed to express markers like TUBB3 and GFAP. (No explicit percentage such as “95% positive” is provided in the document.)  

4. Quality Control Measures and Acceptance Criteria for Each Batch:  
 • Each vial of source cells contains 1×10⁶ cells with a cell count of approximately 1.2×10⁶ cells/mL and a viability of at least 20%.  
 • Tests in the supplied cell batch include:  
  – Positivity for differentiation markers (e.g., TUBB3 and GFAP)  
  – Absence of contaminants (tested free of HIV, HBV, HC, mycoplasma, and sterility tests)  
  – Adherence not exceeding 50%.  
 • A further quality check is performed on the neurospheres (e.g., acceptable round shape, correct sphere size, and proliferative capacity) prior to use in the assay.

5. Passages Used in the Test:  
 • The neurospheres are passaged weekly during expansion, but it is specified that cells should not be used in the NPC1 assay after passage 6.

6. Compliance with GCCP/GIVIMP:  
 • Although the document does not explicitly state “GCCP” or “GIVIMP,” the adherence to standardized SOPs (DB‐ALM format, detailed cell culture protocols, and routine quality checks) indicates that basic good cell culture and in vitro method practices are observed.  

7. Duration of Use for a Given Cell Batch:  
 • Cells are maintained for 3–4 weeks in expansion (with weekly passaging) before they are used in the assay.  
 • The number of passages is limited (no later than passage 6) to ensure adequate proliferative capacity and quality.

8. Freezing Stocks and Cell Bank Preparation:  
 • After initial expansion, cells are frozen in liquid nitrogen.  
 • Standard cryopreservation procedures are followed, whereby cells are resuspended in a thawing medium containing DMSO and then stored appropriately.  
 • The details in the SOP (DB‐ALM format) highlight that stock solutions are aliquoted, stored at –20°C (for compounds) or liquid nitrogen (for cells), and are not thawed more than three times.

9. Obtaining Primary Cells and Their Characterization (for Primary hNPCs):  
 • Primary hNPCs are obtained commercially from Lonza (Verviers, Belgium) as cryopreserved 3D neurospheres.  
 • They are derived from human brain cortex tissue (gestation weeks 16–19).  
 • The cells are characterized via FACS (for markers such as nestin, SOX2, and Ki67), and after differentiation, for markers including TUBB3 and GFAP.  
 • Inclusion criteria include a minimum cell viability (≥20%), correct cell density, free of infectious agents, and the expected marker expression; exclusion criteria include any contamination (e.g., bacterial, fungal, mycoplasma) or a proliferative capacity decline (as shown by deviations in sphere size at seeding).

All of the above details are documented in the maintenance protocol SOP referenced in NPC1.pdf.

────────────────────────
Overall Cell Culture & Assay Setup
────────────────────────
• hNPC Expansion and Differentiation:  
 – Cryopreserved 3D neurospheres (from human cortex, GW16–19) are thawed and expanded over 3–4 weeks with weekly mechanical passaging.  
 – During expansion, cells are cultured in proliferation medium (DMEM/Ham’s F12 [2:1] supplemented with 2% B27, 20 ng/mL EGF, 20 ng/mL recombinant human FGF, and antibiotics).  
 – Critical note: FGF is added freshly (directly before thawing or plating) since it contains 1% bovine serum albumin and is sensitive to batch effects.  
 – Once neurospheres reach a size of 0.2–0.5 mm, individual spheres (typically 0.25–0.35 mm; ideally ~0.3 mm) are selected.

• Plate Preparation:  
 – Spheres are re-plated into poly‑Hema coated 96‑well U‑bottom plates. The poly‑Hema coating is essential to prevent cell attachment and maintain a free‑floating 3D spheroid culture during the assay.
 
────────────────────────
Exposure Scheme Timeline (72 Hours) 
────────────────────────
 [Pre-Assay – Prior to t = 0]
  • Expand and passage hNPCs weekly for ~3–4 weeks.  
  • On the day of the assay, ensure the proliferation medium is pre-warmed (37°C, 5% CO₂) and equilibrated for 15–30 minutes.

 t = 0 Hours (Day 0 – Plating/Initiation)
  • A single neurosphere (0.25–0.35 mm) is placed into each well of a poly‑Hema coated 96‑well plate in 100 µL proliferation medium.
  • At this time, test compounds (prepared via serial dilution and already mixed into the medium so that the final solvent concentration is within acceptable limits) are added simultaneously.
   – Compounds are added only once at the start; no re‑addition is performed since the assay runs under static conditions.
  • No medium change is performed during the entire 72‑hour exposure.

 t = 0 to 72 Hours (Exposure Period)
  • The cells culture in the presence of growth factors (EGF and FGF) supports proliferation.  
  • Brightfield images are acquired at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours to measure changes in sphere size (the primary readout for proliferation by area).
  • No medium or compound refresh occurs during this time.

 t = 56 Hours (During Exposure)
  • BrdU is added to the wells. BrdU incorporation (measured as a luminescence signal) during the last 16 hours serves as an indirect measure of DNA synthesis (NPC1b endpoint).

 t = 72 Hours (Assay Termination)
  • Final imaging is performed.
  • Endpoints are collected: sphere size, BrdU incorporation, along with parallel assessments of cell viability and cytotoxicity (using fluorescence/luminescence assays).

────────────────────────
Additional Critical Points
────────────────────────
• Medium changes:  
 – No medium change is performed during the 72‑hour exposure. The compounds are added only on Day 0. This static exposure ensures that the cells remain continuously exposed to the defined test concentration throughout the assay.

• Re-plating:  
 – Re‑plating of spheres occurs only at the beginning of the assay (when freshly selected, uniform sized neurospheres are transferred into coated 96‑well plates). No further re‑plating is done during the exposure.

• Critical medium supplements:  
 – Proliferation medium must include both EGF and FGF, as they are critical for sphere growth and cell proliferation.  
 – All compounds and solvent controls (DMSO, DPBS, etc.) are prepared such that solvent effects are controlled.

It also describes the method of endpoint assessment and indicates that all endpoints are generated from the same experimental run, which implies a consistent approach to normalization. The inclusion of specific details about the experimental setup and endpoint assessment provides a comprehensive response.","The NPC1 assay uses two primary endpoints that assess proliferation of human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs):

1. Proliferation by area (NPC1a): This is determined by measuring the increase in sphere size (expressed as pixel area over time using brightfield images).  
2. Proliferation by BrdU (NPC1b): This is quantified by BrdU incorporation as an indirect measure of DNA synthesis, detected via a luminescence readout.

Cytotoxicity is not the primary endpoint; instead, it is a secondary endpoint. In addition to cytotoxicity—which is assessed by measuring LDH release (indicative of membrane damage)—cell viability is also measured, by assessing mitochondrial activity via the conversion of resazurin to resorufin.

For normalization of the primary proliferation endpoints, the solvent control (SC) is used as the reference. In the data processing steps, background values (obtained from wells containing medium only) are subtracted from the raw fluorescence or luminescence signals. This ensures that the measured responses (both for proliferation and for the secondary endpoints) are normalized to a defined baseline condition.

Proliferation by area (72h; NPC1a) is assessed as the slope of the increase in sphere size (amount of pixels in the bright-field image, sphere area) over 72 h measured by brightfield microscopy using high content imaging at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. 2. Proliferation by BrdU (72h; NPC1b) is assessed as BrdU incorporation (as an indirect measure of DNA synthesis) over the last 16 h of compound exposure. It is measured as a luminescence signal (relative luminescence unit) in a multi-plate reader after 72 h. Secondary endpoints: 1 . Cytotoxicity 72 h is assessed as membrane integrity by measuring the amount of LDH leaked from cells with damaged plasma membranes. LDH-dependent reduction of resazurin to resorufin is measured in the supernatant of each well as fluorescence of the reaction product resorufin (relative fluorescence unit) in a multi-plate reader after 72 h of compound exposure. 2 . Viability 72 h is assessed as mitochondrial activity by measuring the amount of resazurin reduced to fluorescent resorufin (relative fluorescence unit) in a multi-plate reader in the last two hours of the 72 h proliferation and compound exposure period.",Medium,"The answer provides a detailed description of the endpoints and the methods used to assess them, including the use of brightfield microscopy and multi-plate readers. However, it lacks a general overview of the method's key steps, such as whether cells are fixed or homogenized, and does not address whether endpoints are measured in the same well or under the same conditions. Additionally, it does not explain the quantification algorithm for imaging endpoints or the number of cells imaged.","The assay employs a multiparametric approach where several endpoints are measured from the same cultured neurosphere in each well. For the primary endpoints, one method captures proliferation by quantifying the sphere size (proliferation by area, NPC1a) using brightfield imaging, and the other assesses DNA synthesis via BrdU incorporation (proliferation by BrdU, NPC1b). Brightfield images are taken at defined time points (0, 24, 48 and 72 hours) without prior fixation, and an image analysis algorithm quantifies the area by determining pixel counts in the captured 2D projection. Approximately one sphere per well is monitored and, based on established correlations, a typical 300‑µm sphere corresponds to about 2.6 × 10³ cells. 

In parallel, after compound exposure, the same wells are processed for BrdU detection. For this endpoint, BrdU is added during the final 16 hours, after which cells are fixed, and a chemiluminescence measurement is performed using a multi‑plate reader. Additionally, cell viability (measured by mitochondrial activity with a resazurin conversion assay) and cytotoxicity (via LDH release from damaged membranes) are determined by fluorescence readouts from the same experimental run. These endpoints are run in parallel from the same well, thereby ensuring that all measurements derive from identical culture conditions.

Overall, the procedure does not involve homogenization but maintains the 3D structure of the neurospheres for the imaging-based endpoint; fixation is only applied for the BrdU assay. The quantification of imaging endpoints is based on automated high-content imaging and analysis software that extracts numeric values (e.g., pixel areas) from each image to determine proliferation rates over time.

However, it lacks specific information on machine settings, analytical standards, data processing, normalization procedures, and detailed algorithms for imaging endpoints. The answer is not fully self-contained and requires external sources for complete information.","Based on the NPC1 assay documentation (Source: NPC1.pdf), the following information is provided:

1. Machine Settings and Instrumentation  
 • Imaging is performed by bright‐field microscopy using a High Content Analysis platform (e.g., Cellomics ArrayScan, version 6.6.0, Thermo Fisher). In addition, a multi‐plate reader (e.g., Infinite M200 Pro, Tecan) is employed for luminescence and fluorescence measurements and a liquid handling system (e.g., MICROLAB STAR® M, Hamilton) is used for automated pipetting.  
 • Incubation is carried out at 37°C with 5% CO₂ and a pH of 7.2–7.6.  
 • The SOP in DB‑ALM format (Appendix I in Masjosthusmann et al., 2020) details additional machine settings and calibration requirements.

2. Analytical Standards  
 • For imaging endpoints, spheres must be perfectly round with no disintegrated borders and, for example, a 300-µm sphere should contain ~2.6×10³ cells.  
 • Solvent control values (e.g., DMSO at defined v/v percentages) are used as negative controls for normalization and to establish baseline responses.
 • Positive controls (e.g., cultivation without growth factors) are used to confirm the physiological regulation of hNPC proliferation.

3. Data Processing and Normalization Procedures  
 • For proliferation by BrdU, the algorithm subtracts the mean BrdU background (in relative luminescence units) from each raw response:  
  B_corrected = raw response – Background BrdU.  
 • For viability measurements, the mean background (in relative fluorescence units) is subtracted in a similar manner.  
 • Cytotoxicity data are collected without any pre‑processing.  
 • For the proliferation by area endpoint, sphere size is measured (in pixels) at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours. A linear slope is calculated to represent the increase in sphere area per day. This slope value is used as the input for further analysis.  
 • In a first normalization step, the median of each replicate is normalized to that of the solvent control (SC). Then, the mean response is re‑normalized by dividing each value by the starting point of the curve and multiplying by 100.  
 • Finally, concentration–response profiles are derived by fitting the normalized data with non‑linear regression models using an R‐based evaluation tool (which utilizes the drc package). Confidence intervals are calculated based on prediction bands around the fitted curve.

4. Detailed Algorithm for Imaging Endpoints  
 Step A: Image Acquisition  
  – Acquire bright‑field images at defined time points (0h, 24h, 48h, and 72h) on the Cellomics ArrayScan.  
 Step B: Image Analysis  
  – The Cellomics scan software automatically identifies individual neurospheres based on shape criteria (ensuring they are round, within the target size range of 0.25–0.35 mm, and not aggregated).  
  – The sphere area is quantified as the number of pixels per sphere.  
 Step C: Data Extraction  
  – Export the determined area values into the experimental AXES sheet for each well and time point.  
 Step D: Slope Calculation  
  – Calculate the slope representing the proliferation by area over 72 hours (using area measurements at 0h, 24h, 48h, and 72h). This slope (in pixels/day) is used as the primary metric for the proliferation assay.  
 Step E: Quality Control

Controls for Primary endpoints: hNPC proliferation is diminished by the withdrawal of growth factors (EGF and FGF). Spheres are plated in medium not containing EGF and FGF. This positive control demonstrates the physiological functionality of the growth factor-dependent regulation of hNPC proliferation. Inhibition of the growth factor-dependent proliferation causes a reduction of proliferation to 0% of the solvent control (SC, see 5.7) for proliferation by area (NPC1a) and 0-40% of the SC for proliferation by BrdU (NPC1b). 2.

1. Withdrawal of EGF/FGF (Growth Factor Depletion)  
 • Why MCC: Removing the two human growth factors that drive hNPC proliferation directly tests the assay’s dependence on growth factor signaling.  
 • Expected Data: Proliferation by area (NPC1a) is reduced to approximately 0% of the solvent control (SC), and BrdU incorporation (NPC1b) reaches 0–40% of SC.  
 • Note: This manipulation is run with every experiment and is used to set day‐to‐day AC.

2. EGFR Inhibitor (PD153035)  
 • Why MCC: PD153035 specifically inhibits the EGFR, an essential mediator of the EGF signal. Inhibiting EGFR confirms that EGFR-mediated signaling is driving the proliferation response.  
 • Expected Data: A significant reduction in both sphere growth (NPC1a) and DNA synthesis (NPC1b) compared to the solvent control.  
  _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_

3. 0.2% Triton X-100  
 • Why MCC: This compound causes immediate cell lysis and thus is used as a positive control in the viability and cytotoxicity endpoints. It directly verifies that the assay can detect loss of cell membrane integrity.  
 • Expected Data: Maximum cytotoxicity (a high fluorescence signal in the cytotoxicity assay) and extremely low viability in the respective assays.  
 • Note: It is a daily performance control for verifying the integrity of secondary endpoint measurements.  
  _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_

4. Cadmium Chloride  
 • Why MCC: Cadmium chloride is a known developmental neurotoxicant that adversely affects cell proliferation. It has been shown to reduce proliferation in the NPC1 assay.  
 • Expected Data: A concentration‐dependent reduction in proliferation (both sphere size and BrdU incorporation), serving as an established positive control for DNT effects.  
  _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_

5. All-trans Retinoic Acid  
 • Why MCC: This compound is recognized as a DNT positive agent and modulates developmental processes such as proliferation.  
 • Expected Data: A marked reduction in proliferation markers (NPC1a and NPC1b) when compared with solvent controls.  
  _(Source: NPC1.pdf)_

6. Dexamethasone  
 • Why MCC: Dexamethasone is listed among compounds known to cause DNT effects. Its impact on NPC proliferation supports its role as a mechanistic control.  
 • Expected Data: A significant decrease in sphere growth and BrdU incorporation relative to SC, thus confirming its expected inhibitory effect on the proliferative process.

Correlation with Pathway Activity  
• In the NPC1 assay, inhibition of the growth factor signaling (via withdrawal of EGF/FGF or the use of PD153035) directly correlates with a loss of proliferative capacity of hNPCs.  
• Likewise, the induction of cell lysis by Triton X-100 reliably yields a maximal cytotoxic response.  
• Therefore, perturbations (whether by pathway inhibition or by a neurotoxic challenge with agents such as cadmium chloride, all‑trans retinoic acid, or dexamethasone) yield assay responses that are in line with the known mechanistic effects on the relevant signaling pathways.  

In summary, the most critical controls for routine day‐to‐day performance (and for establishing acceptance criteria) are the growth factor withdrawal manipulation and the use of 0.2% Triton X-100. These, along with the additional MCC compounds, confirm that both specific signaling (e.g. via EGFR) and overall cell health are accurately reflected in the assay endpoints.

What chemicals/manipulations are used as positive controls? Describe the expected data on such controls (signal and its uncertainty)? How good are in vivo reference data on the positive controls? Are in vivo relevant threshold concentrations known?,"The NPC1 hNPC proliferation assay correctly identified the following compounds that are known to cause DNT in humans or in vivo (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020; Blum et al., 2023): Cadmium chloride Dexamethasone Hexachlorophene Chlorpromazine hydrochloride Methylazoxymethanol acetate all-trans-Retinoic acid Tributyltin chloride Sodium valproate all-trans-Retinoic acid",Low,"The answer lists chemicals used as positive controls but does not describe the expected data on these controls, such as signal and its uncertainty. It also does not address the quality of in vivo reference data or whether in vivo relevant threshold concentrations are known.","1. For the primary endpoints, the assay uses the withdrawal of growth factors (EGF and FGF) as a positive control. When hNPC spheres are plated in medium without these growth factors, proliferation is dramatically reduced. In this setup, the proliferation‐by‐area endpoint (NPC1a) typically drops to 0% relative to the solvent control, and for the BrdU endpoint (NPC1b) the signal is reduced to between 0 and 40% of the solvent control signal (Source: NPC1.pdf, pages 107–109).

2. For the secondary endpoints (viability and cytotoxicity), 0.2% Triton X-100 is used as the positive control. Because Triton X-100 lyses cells completely, it produces a maximal response in both endpoints (maximal increase in cytotoxicity and corresponding loss of viability) (Source: NPC1.pdf, pages 107–109).

3. In terms of signal uncertainty, the inter‐experimental variation for the positive control is very low for proliferation by area (around 1.1% CV) and somewhat higher for proliferation by BrdU (approximately 10.3% CV). This shows that the positive control response for proliferation by area is very robust while the BrdU measurement has a little more variability (Source: NPC1.pdf, page 120).

4. Regarding the in vivo reference data, although several compounds (e.g. dexamethasone, all‑trans retinoic acid, tributyltin chloride, sodium valproate) that are known DNT‑positive in vivo have been correctly identified using the NPC1 assay, the document does not provide comprehensive or quantitative in vivo threshold concentrations for these positive controls. In fact, the in vitro–in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) parameters have not yet been determined. Therefore, in vivo relevant threshold concentrations are not well established (Source: NPC1.pdf, pages 116–117 and page 121).",0.6871181667128312,0.23808452486991882,-0.1039096787571907,0.04528718814253807
"What chemicals/manipulations are used as negative controls? Describe the expected data on such controls (signal and its uncertainty)? (Such data define the background noise of the test method) What is the rationale for the concentration setting of negative controls? Do you use unspecific controls? If yes, indicate the compounds and the respective rationale for their use and the concentration selection.","The solvent control (SC) is used as a negative control that is run on each experimental plate. Each solvent has to be established for its use as a solvent control by comparing the effect of the SC to the effect of medium only. Established solvent controls show the same response as the medium control. The SC is used to assess if the acceptability criteria for NPC1 proliferation are met and for normalization of the compound exposure and the positive control response. Established SCs are: DMSO: 0.3% v/v; 0.2% v/v; 0.1% v/v DPBS: 2% v/v ddH2O: 2% v/v MeOH: 0.1% v/v Other negative control compounds that were identified as negative in this assay and are known to not affect neurodevelopmental endpoints in vivo include (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020): Acetaminophen Amoxicillin Aspirin Buspirone Chlorpheniramine maleate D-Glucitol Diethylene glycol D-Mannitol Doxylamine succinate Famotidine Ibuprofen Metformin Metoprolol Penicillin VK Saccharin Sodium benzoate Warfarin",Medium,"The answer provides a list of chemicals used as negative controls and their concentrations, which partially addresses the question. However, it lacks a detailed explanation of the expected data on these controls, such as signal and its uncertainty, and the rationale for concentration settings. Additionally, it does not clearly address the use of unspecific controls or provide a rationale for their use and concentration selection.","1. The assay’s negative controls are based on solvent controls (SC) that mimic the test compound’s vehicle. Established negative controls include:
 • DMSO at 0.3% (or 0.1–0.3% v/v), DPBS (2% v/v), ddH₂O (2% v/v) and MeOH (0.1% v/v). These solvents are used at the highest concentration applied to the test compounds so that any observed effects can be attributed to the compound and not to the vehicle itself. This setup ensures that the solvent‐containing medium elicits the same response as medium only. (Source: NPC1.pdf, “Negative and unspecific controls”)

2. The expected data from these negative controls define the background noise for the assay. For instance, in the solvent control:
 • Proliferation by area (NPC1a) should produce a slope in sphere growth between 1000–3000 pixels/day.
 • For the BrdU incorporation readout (NPC1b), the raw signal in treatment conditions is expected not to fall below that of the positive control (i.e. spheres cultured without growth factors) and the SC signal must be significantly higher than that of the positive control.
 • The observed variability (expressed as coefficient of variation) for SC replicates is around 19.4 ± 9.4% for NPC1a and 13.2 ± 5.9% for NPC1b. These values provide an estimate of the background uncertainty in the test method. (Source: NPC1.pdf, “Negative and unspecific controls” and “Test Performance”)

3. The rationale for the concentration settings of negative controls is to match the highest solvent concentration present in any test condition. This ensures that any effect due solely to the solvent is controlled for and that the assay’s background is defined under the same exposure conditions as the test compounds. (Source: NPC1.pdf, “Preparation/addition of test compounds”)

4. In addition to the vehicle controls, the assay also employs unspecific control compounds. A set of “negative control compounds” known not to affect neurodevelopmental endpoints in vivo is included. These compounds include:
 • Acetaminophen, Amoxicillin, Aspirin, Buspirone, Chlorpheniramine maleate, D‑Glucitol, Diethylene glycol, D‑Mannitol, Doxylamine succinate, Famotidine, Ibuprofen, Metformin, Metoprolol, Penicillin VK, Saccharin, Sodium benzoate, and Warfarin.
The rationale behind including these unspecific control compounds is to verify that the assay produces no “false positive” signal on the specific neurodevelopmental endpoint (i.e. NPC proliferation) when exposed to chemicals that are known not to affect neurodevelopment in vivo. Their selection and concentrations are designed to parallel the conditions of the test compounds yet not induce any significant alterations in the measured endpoints. (Source: NPC1.pdf, “Negative and unspecific controls”)

5. For the secondary endpoints (cytotoxicity and viability), 0.2% Triton X‑100 is used as a positive control due to its property to lyse cells completely. This control serves as an unspecific control for maximal effect, ensuring that the assay can distinguish between baseline viability and complete cell lysis. Its concentration (0.2%) is chosen because it reliably produces a maximal response without interference from test compounds. (Source: NPC1.pdf, “Controls for Secondary endpoints”)

In summary, the assay uses solvent controls and well‑characterized negative control compounds to define the background signal and its uncertainty, while unspecific controls such as Triton X‑100 are applied for the secondary endpoints to confirm that the assay can detect a maximal response. The concentration settings are rationalized to mimic the highest solvent exposure levels applied in test compound conditions.",0.8402547741284052,0.29512500762939453,-0.020136341452598572,0.12051749229431152

Which rule do you apply to test whether a test run is within the normal performance frame? How do you document this decision? Indicate actions if the AC are not met.,General acceptance criteria: 1. At least three replicate values (technical replicates) need to be present for each condition (concentration) to be accepted for the data analysis. 2. At least five conditions and the solvent control need to be present for the experiment to be accepted in the data analysis for concentration response modeling,Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by providing general acceptance criteria for data analysis, which implies a rule for normal performance. However, it lacks clarity on how the decision is documented and does not specify actions if the acceptance criteria are not met.","The decision is based on comparing the test‐run data against the predefined acceptance criteria (AC) outlined in the assay protocol. In practice, you verify that: 

• Each condition has at least three technical replicates and at least five test conditions along with the solvent control are included.  
• The control endpoints (e.g. the solvent control and the positive control—cells cultured without EGF/FGF) exhibit the specified performance (for example, the slope of proliferation by area needs to be between 1,000 and 3,000 pixels/day and BrdU values in the SC must be significantly higher than in the positive control).  
• Other acceptance parameters such as the sphere shape (perfectly round with no disintegrated borders) and starting sphere size (approximately 300 µm diameter, corresponding to about 2.6 × 10³ cells) are met.

This “rule” ensures that the run lies within the normal performance frame. 

All these checks are documented in the experiment’s AXES sheet where every meta‑data item (e.g. plating date, experimenter, NPC passage, plate map, raw data points) is recorded and any deviations from the SOP (including outlier wells or technical issues such as pipetting errors) are clearly noted in the comment section.

If the acceptance criteria are not met, the following actions are taken: 

• The data from the compromised wells or even the entire run are flagged and excluded from further data analysis.  
• Deviations are detailed in the AXES sheet, and if necessary, the experiment is repeated or additional testing is performed to cover the missing performance.

In the fully automated set up, 10 plates with 8 conditions (Figure 4) and 4 replicates per condition can be run in one week by two laboratory technicians. This results in the generation of 400 data points for each endpoint within one week (excluding all controls). The throughput is therefore estimated as medium.",Low,"The answer does not address the specific question about 'real data points per month' or the possibility/extent of repeated measures from the same dish. It provides information about the setup and throughput per week, but does not translate this into a monthly count or discuss repeated measures over time.","Based on the throughput data provided in NPC1.pdf, a fully automated run uses 10 plates per week. Each plate is set up to test 8 concentration conditions (with technical replicates averaged into a single “real” data point), and controls are not counted. The document states that this set‐up generates 400 data points per week for each endpoint. Assuming three working weeks in a month, one obtains about 400 × 3 ≈ 1,200 real data points per endpoint per month. 

For repeated measures, note that the sphere area (proliferation by area) is captured via brightfield imaging at several time points (0, 24, 48, and 72 hours) for each well. This means that while the same dish is imaged repeatedly over time, these kinetic measures are used to assess the growth curve for a given concentration and are not counted as independent data points (because technical replicates and time‐course data for one condition are aggregated to one overall data point for that concentration).

The test conditions are prepared in a serial dilution from the stock solution (Figure 4). Stock solutions are prepared by diluting the compound in the solvent (e.g. DMSO) in a concentration that allows the preparation of the highest test concentration without exceeding the highest acceptable solvent concentration (see 0). For DMSO the highest acceptable solvent concentration is 0.3% which means that the stock concentration needs to be at least 1000x higher than the highest test concentration. Stock solutions in non-sterile solvents (e.g. water or PBS) have to be sterile filtrated using a sterile syringe filter (diameter = 0.2 µm). Adsorption to the filter needs to be considered. Stock solutions are aliquoted and stored at -20°C. A stock solution is not thawed more than three times. For the preparation of the test condition, the stock solution is diluted to the highest test concentration (default 1:1000) in proliferation medium. All following dilutions are prepared by serial dilution of the highest concentration in proliferation medium with solvent (in the concentration of the highest test concentration). The default serial dilution is 1:3 which covers a concentration range from e.g. 20 µM to 27 nM (729-fold). Depending on the desired concentration range, the dilution can be adjusted to 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, or other. The SC is prepared by adding the solvent to proliferation medium in the same concentration as the highest test concentration. 100 µL of the compound dilutions and the SC are added to each well of a 96 well plate (Figure 4). Alternatively, the serial dilution can be prepared directly in the 96 well plates. One hNPC sphere is added to each well after the medium equilibrated for 15 to 30 min at 37°C and 5% CO2. To subtract the background fluorescence of the phenol red-containing medium, 4 wells with medium only (Background, without cells, Figure 4) are prepared for the viability and cytotoxicity assays. Figure 4 Plating Scheme. The type of solvent control depends on the solvent of the compound that was tested. 7 compound concentrations (for each compound) are plated in a serial dilution from lowest (left) to highest (right) concentration. The positive control for cell proliferation is proliferation medium without EGF and FGF. BrdU background is used for the proliferation assay by BrdU (spheres in SC medium). Background and lysis control are used for cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. 2 different compounds can be investigated on one plate (blue and purple).",Medium,"The answer provides a detailed description of the preparation of compound stocks, including concentration, solvent use, and storage conditions. It also describes the preparation of dilutions and the addition of test compounds to the test system. However, it lacks specific details on the range of volumes, particular lab ware/instruments for dispensing, temperature/lighting considerations, and decision rules for the solvent. Additionally, it does not address tests of solubility as stocks and in culture medium comprehensively.","The protocol describes compound handling as follows (Sources: NPC1.pdf):

• Stock Preparation and Solvent Choice:  
– Compounds are first dissolved in an appropriate solvent (typically DMSO is used) at a concentration at least 1,000‐fold higher than the highest test concentration so that the final solvent level in the assay does not exceed the acceptable maximum (e.g. 0.3% v/v for DMSO).  
– The solvent choice is based on the highest useable solvent concentration and the compound’s solubility; established solvent controls (e.g. DMSO, DPBS, ddH₂O, or MeOH) are run in parallel to verify that the solvent itself does not cause effects (NPC1 accepts DMSO at 0.1–0.3% v/v, among others).  
– When using non-sterile solvents (water or PBS), the stock solution is passed through a sterile syringe filter (0.2 µm diameter) to ensure sterility, while being mindful of potential adsorption to the filter.  

• Stock Verification, Aliquoting and Storage:  
– Once prepared, compound stocks are aliquoted and stored at –20°C.  
– Stocks are not thawed more than three times to preserve integrity.  
– The preparation ensures that the stock concentration (fold concentration) is high enough (≥1,000×) so that serial dilutions in proliferation medium remain within the solvent’s acceptable concentration.

• Serial Dilution and Preparation of Test Conditions:  
– For the test condition, the stock is first diluted 1:1000 into the proliferation medium (which serves as the dilution medium and test matrix).  
– Further dilutions are typically performed as a serial dilution (by default 1:3, but options include 1:2, 1:5, 1:10 etc.) to achieve the desired concentration range (e.g. 20 µM down to 27 nM).  
– These serial dilutions can be prepared in tubes or, alternatively, directly in the 96‐well plate.

• Volumes, Labware and Dispensing Instruments:  
– For each condition, 100 µL of the prepared compound dilution (or the solvent control prepared identically to the highest test concentration) is dispensed into wells of a 96‐well U‑bottom plate.  
– Dispensing is typically automated using a liquid handling system (for example a MICROLAB STAR® M or similar) to ensure precision and reduce variability.  
– The entire test is conducted in poly‑HEMA coated plates to prevent cell attachment.
  
• Temperature, Lighting and Handling Considerations:  
– All compound dilutions and subsequent cell culture steps are prepared in proliferation medium and are handled at ambient temperature until cells are added.  
– The medium and plates are pre-equilibrated at 37°C and 5% CO₂ for 15–30 minutes before the addition of hNPC spheres, ensuring that temperature and CO₂ are stable during compound addition.  
– There is no specific mention of controlled lighting during compound addition; however, standard cell culture conditions (dimmed or standard laboratory lighting) are assumed.

• Final Addition to the Test System:  
– After 100 µL of compound (or solvent control) solution has been added to each well, one hNPC sphere (approximately 0.25–0.35 mm in diameter) is transferred into each well.  
– The cells are added after the medium has equilibrated so that compounds and test cells are in immediate contact in the same well.  
– There is no additional medium change indicated at the time of compound addition; instead, the compound dilutions are prepared in the complete proliferation medium.  

In summary, the method employs precise volumes (100 µL per well), uses automated liquid handling along with sterile handling measures (e.g. 0.2 µm syringe filters for stocks in water/PBS), and adheres to strict temperature equilibration (37°C/5% CO₂) prior to cell addition. Compound stocks are prepared at high concentrations (≥1,000× the highest test concentration) in a chosen solvent (usually DMSO), verified for solubility, aliquoted, stored at –20°C, and serially diluted directly in proliferation medium before being dispensed into a 96‑well plate followed by the addition of one hNPC sphere per well (Sources: NPC1.pdf).",0.8382958699460042,0.22788028419017792,0.10688305646181107,0.1677992343902588

Lab‐specific procedures for calculating test compound concentrations are also clearly defined. Stock solutions are first prepared by diluting the compound in the appropriate solvent at a concentration at least 1,000 times higher than the highest test concentration. This ensures that when the compound is diluted (typically by serial dilutions with a default factor of 1:3), the final solvent concentration remains at or below the tested maximum (e.g., 0.3% for DMSO).

The answer is incomplete and lacks clarity on several aspects of the question.","The NPC1 assay’s SOP details a structured approach for pipetting that is fully integrated into the overall documentation system. In brief:

1. The pipetting schedule is pre‐defined in the SOP in DB‑ALM format (see Appendix I in Masjosthusmann et al., 2020, as referenced in section 6.6). The experimental plan (including timing of all pipetting steps) is recorded and followed by using the Automated Experimental Evaluation (AXES) sheet. This sheet logs metadata (e.g. plating date, experimenter, compound identity, compound concentrations, and plate map) and also records the exact time points of each pipetting/addition step.

2. Adherence to the plate map is ensured by using a clearly defined plating scheme (illustrated in Figure 4 of the document) that specifies which wells are used for each test condition (including test compounds, solvent controls, background wells, etc.). The plate map is documented as part of the AXES sheet metadata so that the intended layout is traceable for every experiment.

3. Throughout the experimental run, any intermediate steps are monitored and all deviations (including potential errors or uncertainties) are recorded in the comment section of the AXES sheet. This includes documenting pipetting mistakes (for example, if pipetting is inadvertently performed twice in one well) and any deviations from the predetermined plan. Wells that are affected by such errors are flagged and later excluded from data analysis.

4. The sequential use of the plate wells follows the serial dilution pattern as described in the plating scheme. In this pattern, wells are filled in a defined order (typically from left to right and top to bottom according to Figure 4) with test conditions prepared in a serial dilution series. This consistent pattern helps track and normalize responses.

Thus, the combination of the pre‐established SOP in DB‑ALM format, the use of an automated documentation system (AXES sheet) that includes the plate map and time-stamped metadata, and the routine entry of any pipetting deviations or errors ensures full traceability and reliability of the pipetting steps in the NPC1 assay.

"How is the concentration range of test compounds defined (e.g. only single concentrations, always 1:10 serial dilutions or variable dilution factors, ten different concentrations, etc.)? Is there a rule for defining starting dilutions? For functional endpoints that may not provide full concentration-response, how is the test concentration defined? E.g. EC10 of viability data are usually tested for gene expression endpoints. Detailed information should also be included in an SOP, preferably in DB-ALM format (see link in 6.6).","Starting concentrations and concentration ranges are defined based on the following factors: - toxicological relevance of the compound (i.e. internal human exposures, effects at lowest concentrations) - solubility of the compound - highest useable solvent concentration These factors are determined based on available information (databases/literature) or experimentally (e.g. solubility test).",Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by mentioning factors that influence the definition of starting concentrations and concentration ranges, such as toxicological relevance, solubility, and solvent concentration. However, it lacks specific details on the concentration range (e.g., single concentrations, serial dilutions) and does not address how test concentrations are defined for functional endpoints that may not provide full concentration-response. Additionally, there is no mention of an SOP or DB-ALM format.","The concentration range is defined by first considering toxicological relevance, solubility, and the highest solvent concentrations that still yield no solvent effects. For example, when using DMSO the highest acceptable concentration is 0.3% v/v; therefore, the stock solution must be made at least 1000× more concentrated than the highest test concentration. From this stock, the test conditions are prepared by serial dilution. The default dilution factor is 1:3 (resulting, for instance, in a concentration span from about 20 µM to 27 nM, a roughly 729‑fold range), but dilution factors may be adjusted (e.g. 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, or other) depending on the specific requirements for the toxicant and its solubility.

For functional endpoints that do not provide a full concentration–response curve (such as some gene expression endpoints in viability studies), the test concentration is defined by using the highest test concentration that is statistically significantly different from the lowest, as determined (for instance) by a Tukey HSD test. If the full response is not reached and the confidence interval spans above the tested range, the highest test concentration (or 1.5× the highest tested concentration) is used to define the endpoint concentration. Detailed information on these settings and procedures is provided in the SOP (available in DB‑ALM format, see link in section 6.6).

It mentions specific issues like interference from fluorescent compounds, low solubility, and the need for automation to reduce variability. The response also highlights potential pitfalls such as edge effects and the importance of consistent pipetting, making it relevant and complete.","Problematic compounds and sources of error have been identified for the NPC1 assay as follows (Source: NPC1.pdf):

• Problematic compounds include those with high volatility, high lipophilicity (high Kow) and low solubility in the established solvents. Such compounds may have precipitation issues or cause interference, for example if they are fluorescent, which can affect the readouts for viability and cytotoxicity assays.

• Experimental variables that are hard to control include pipetting steps (which may introduce variability, especially in viability or cytotoxicity assays that depend on the exact volume added) and the potential interference from fluorescent compounds that could mask or confound the assay’s fluorescent endpoint readouts.

• Critical handling steps include:
 – Fast dilution of thawed cells, since the thawing medium contains DMSO which can adversely affect cell health.
 – Adding FGF directly before thawing to minimize batch effects.
 – Using careful medium exchange (using a 1,000 µL pipet) during the early expansion phase to avoid accidental removal of small neurospheres.
 – Minimizing incubator re‐opening and vibrations to prevent temperature/CO₂ fluctuations and sphere aggregation.
 – Ensuring that the neurospheres are well distributed in the petri dishes (and transferring attached cells gently) to prevent inadvertent aggregations.

• Robustness issues include operator-dependent variations (e.g., differences in selecting sphere sizes within the acceptable range, or pipetting errors), consumable issues (e.g., FGF batch effects due to its bovine serum albumin content), and environmental factors (e.g., vibrations and frequent incubator opening). Operators must be trained carefully to prevent technical deviations such as mis-pipetting or leaving spheres attached during feeding.

a) Other endpoints – Although the assay currently focuses on NPC proliferation, additional endpoints may be integrated to address other neurodevelopmental processes. For instance, endpoints for cell differentiation (e.g. immunocytochemical staining for neuronal, astrocytic or oligodendrocyte markers), apoptosis, neurite outgrowth or migration could complement the current readouts. (Sources: NPC1.pdf)

b) Other analytical methods for the same endpoint – For the proliferation endpoints, alternative quantification methods may be considered. Besides the described brightfield imaging to measure sphere area (NPC1a) and BrdU incorporation with luminescence read‐out (NPC1b), one could use fluorescence-based DNA synthesis assays (or nuclear staining approaches with automated imaging), live-cell imaging to track sphere growth in real time, or other endpoint-specific methods such as quantitative PCR for proliferation markers. (Sources: NPC1.pdf)

c) Other exposure schemes – The standard protocol uses a single 72‐hour exposure without renewal. Variations could involve repeated dosing or prolonged exposure periods (beyond 72 hours) to explore chronic effects on proliferation. Also, a sequential exposure scheme (e.g. introducing a recovery phase) could be implemented to better mimic in vivo exposure scenarios. (Sources: NPC1.pdf)

d) Experimental variations – The assay allows opportunities to modify conditions and evaluate mechanistic aspects. For example, one may alter the medium composition (e.g. changing concentrations of EGF and FGF or using a medium with modified supplements), or include pharmacological inhibitors (such as the EGFR inhibitor PD153035) or substrates to probe specific pathways affecting NPC proliferation.

1. Raw Data Format and General Explanation:
• Raw data are exported from instruments such as a multi-plate reader (for luminescence and fluorescence endpoints) and high‑content imaging software (for sphere size measurements).  
• They are provided in non‑proprietary Excel files that include one value per well for each measured endpoint. For example, each well’s file may have individual identifiers (e.g. plate number, well ID) along with measured values such as fluorescence (RFU) for viability and luminescence (RLU) for BrdU incorporation.
• In addition to the endpoint signals, the raw file will contain information on the test conditions (e.g., compound identity, concentration, type of control, etc.).  
• These raw Excel files form the starting point for data processing in the “AXES sheet”, where data points are aligned together with the experiment metadata for further normalization, curve fitting, and concentration‑response analysis using the CRStats R package.

However, it lacks comprehensive information on normalization steps and how summary data like EC50 or PoD are specifically derived. The description is not fully clear or complete for all processing steps.","The raw data in the NPC1 assay are processed in several defined steps before summary parameters such as EC50, BMCs, ratios, or points of departure (PoD) are obtained. The processing steps are as follows (Sources: NPC1.pdf):

1. Background correction:  
 • For endpoints measured via luminescence (BrdU) or fluorescence (viability), a background value is determined from wells containing medium only or from specific background controls. For example, for the BrdU endpoint, the mean background measured in BrdU control wells is subtracted from each raw luminescence signal using:  
  Background‐corrected response (RLU) = raw response (RLU) – Background BrdU (RLU).  
 • For viability, the mean background from medium-only wells (measured as RFU) is subtracted from each raw response value.  
 • In the case of cytotoxicity, no pre‐processing is applied.  

2. Normalization:  
 • Once background‐corrected, the data for endpoints measured with multi‐plate readers are normalized to the solvent control (SC) for each experiment plate by determining the median response in the SC and normalizing each replicate to that value.  
 • For the cytotoxicity assay, an alternative normalization is used in which each response is normalized between the lysis control and the solvent control by:  
  normalized response = (lysis control – response) / (lysis control – solvent control).  
 • Additionally, for endpoints where the kinetics of response are important (e.g., sphere size for proliferation by area), the reaction starting point (typically measured at time zero) is used to re‐normalize the values. That is, the mean response of the starting point is used to re‐express all subsequent responses as a percentage of the starting value.

3. Curve fitting and derivation of summary parameters:  
 • The normalized and re‐normalized response data are then subjected to a concentration–response curve fitting.  
 • The R package “drc” is used to test several nonlinear models and determine the best fit (often using Akaike’s information criteria).  
 • From the best-fit curve, parameters such as the EC50 or benchmark concentrations (BMCs) are derived. For instance, a benchmark response (BMR) is defined (e.g., 30% change for proliferation endpoints or 10% for cytotoxicity) and the corresponding BMC (and its confidence limits) is calculated by determining at what concentration the model curve intersects the BMR.

4. Final summary data:  
 • After curve fitting, the final summary parameters range from effective concentration (such as EC50) to BMC values and associated ratios or points of departure (PoD) that are used for risk assessment. All steps, including re‐normalization to day-0 values if applicable, ensure that inter-experiment variability is reduced.

These steps—from raw data background subtraction, normalization against relevant controls, to data fitting with an appropriate nonlinear model—are applied to each endpoint (proliferation by area, proliferation by BrdU, viability and cytotoxicity) to produce the final summary values (Sources: NPC1.pdf).",0.7556984771954871,0.026005057618021965,0.011757501401007175,0.02277933806180954
"How are data normally handled to obtain the overall test result (e.g. concentration response fitting using model X, determination of EC50 by method Y, use of EC50 as final data)? How do you model your concentration response curve (e.g. LL.4 parameter fit) and which software do you use (e.g. GraphPad Prism, R, etc.)? Do you usually calculate an uncertainty measure of your summary data (e.g. a 95% confidence interval for the BMC or a BMCL), and with which software? Can you give uncertainty for non-cytotoxicity or no-effect? How do you handle non-monotonic curve shapes or other curve features that are hard to describe with the usual mathematical fit model?","The data is normalized to the SC and re-normalized to the starting point of the curve. For the normalization to the SC the median of each replicate data point is normalized to the median of the SC in the respective experiment. For the cytotoxicity assays the following normalization is used instead of the normalization to the SC. Here again each response value is normalized using the median of the lysis control and the median of the solvent control. lysis control − response normalized response = lysis control − solvent control The R package drc is used to calculate the optimal fit for each experiment. For calculations of curve fits and BMCs, the data from independent experiments is pooled (median of all replicate values for one concentration). Several non-linear models are run with the concentration response data of each endpoint and the Akaike´s information criteria is used to determine the best fit. For re-normalization of the data, the response value of the curves starting point is determined and used to re-normalize all response values. Therefore, each mean response value is divided by the starting point of the curve and multiplied with 100. For the re-normalized response values the curve fitting is repeated to produce the final concentration response curve. For deriving a reference point (RP) or point of departure (Pod) the Benchmark Concentration (BMC) approach as recommended by the EFSA Scientific Committee (Hardy et al., 2017) is applied. The BMC approach makes use of all data points that define the fitted concentration response curve. Thereby, the BMC is defined as the concentration that is associated with a specific change in response, the Benchmark Response (BMR). The BMR is a value of effect size and should be defined as an effect size that is higher than the general variability of the measured endpoint. The BMR is therefore determined based on the variability of the respective endpoint. BMR for NPC1: proliferation by area BMR30 proliferation by BrdU BMR30 cytotoxicity 72 h BMR10 viability 72 h BMR30 Based on the BMR and the concentration response curve, the evaluation tool calculates the BMC, as well as upper and lower confidence limits (BMCU and BMCL respectively) based on the predict function in the R package drc. The predict function calculates the prediction bands around the concentration response curve based on the deviation between independent experiments and gives an estimation of the area that is expected to enclose 95% of future data points. The BMCL is thereby defined as the intersection of the lower band and the BMR while the BMCU is defined as the intersection of the upper band and the BMR. The confidence intervals are used to access the uncertainty of the BMC. If the BMCU is 1.5 times above the test range, the original BMCU is replaced by 1.5x the highest tested concentration.",High,"The answer comprehensively addresses the question by detailing the data handling process, including normalization and re-normalization methods, the use of the R package 'drc' for curve fitting, and the calculation of BMCs with confidence intervals. It also explains how non-linear models are selected using Akaike's information criteria and how uncertainty is measured. The response covers the modeling of concentration response curves, the software used, and the handling of non-monotonic curves, providing a complete and relevant explanation.","The overall approach is to take the raw endpoint data (e.g., sphere area or BrdU luminescence) and normalize it to the solvent control before fitting a concentration–response curve. For the curve fitting, several non‐linear models are run (for example, a 4‑parameter, LL.4, fit among others), with the optimal model being selected via the Akaike information criterion. Instead of using the EC50 as the final summary statistic, the assay uses the benchmark concentration (BMC) approach where a benchmark response (BMR) is defined (e.g. BMR30 for proliferation endpoints), and the BMC along with its 95% confidence intervals (BMCL and BMCU) are calculated. These calculations are performed using an R‑based evaluation tool that employs the drc package for concentration–response analysis (Source: NPC1.pdf, “Raw data processing to summary data” and “Curve fitting” sections). 

If an endpoint such as non-cytotoxicity or a no-effect situation does not reach the BMR, then the unspecific endpoint’s BMCL is assumed to be the highest tested concentration. In cases where the curve shape is non‑monotonic or does not fit well to the usual models, several models are tested and, in addition to statistical significance (e.g. via a Tukey HSD test when the confidence intervals span or extend beyond the test range), expert judgment is applied to determine the hit classification (specific versus unspecific) (Sources: NPC1.pdf, “Curve fitting” and “Prediction model” sections).",0.8220316037358617,0.09043361246585846,0.16723407804965973,0.13109730184078217

The test system therefore measures adverse events in the young (fetal) developing brain. Different types of NPC exist in the developing brain. Besides ventricular zone NPC, radial glia cells serve as cortical progenitor cells responsible for cortical expansion and folding. As whole cortices were used for cell preparation, this is not a specific NPC type but rather a mix of NPCs found in fetal human cortex during development. The toxicological events that are modeled concern events that influence proliferation of NPCs found in human cortex during the fetal phase",Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by explaining the scientific rationale and the biological processes modeled (proliferation in fetal brain development). However, it lacks clarity and completeness regarding the specific toxicological targets, the full range of toxicological events modeled, the specific human adverse outcomes related, and the hazards potentially predicted by the test method.","The NPC1 assay is designed to model a key developmental process in the human central nervous system—namely, the proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from the fetal brain cortex. This cell proliferation is crucial for proper brain construction during the fetal period, and disturbances in this process have been linked in vivo to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes such as cognitive dysfunction. 

More specifically, the assay uses primary human NPCs cultured as 3D neurospheres to mimic fetal brain growth. The key biological process modeled is fetal NPC proliferation, which is measured by changes in sphere size (via image analysis) and DNA synthesis (via BrdU incorporation). In addition, secondary endpoints assessing cell viability and cytotoxicity provide information on overall cell health.

Thus, the assay targets the developing brain with the underlying assumption that compounds interfering with NPC proliferation can lead to altered brain development and potentially result in neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., cognitive dysfunction). In other words, the test method is aimed at predicting hazards related to adverse effects on cell proliferation, which are critical for brain development, thereby linking specific in vitro readouts to a relevant in vivo adverse outcome.

What is a ‘hit’ if the test is used in screening mode (= hit definition, if different from above)?","Two prediction models (PM) are applied for the NPC1 assay. One PM for a downregulation (PM downregulation) and one PM for an upregulation (PM upregulation) in cell proliferation. PM downregulation The PM uses hit definition based on comparison of the confidence intervals (CI) for the BMC of the DNT- specific endpoint (BMCs) and the unspecific endpoint (cytotoxicity/viability; BMCus). Thereby the following four hit classifications apply: “no hit” “specific hit”: “borderline hit”: “unspecific hit” The compound is not defined as a hit. The compound is defined as hit and the CI’s do not overlap, meaning that the upper confidence limit of the specific endpoint (BMCUs) is lower than the lower confidence limit of the unspecific endpoint (BMCLus). The compound is defined as hit and the CI of the specific endpoint overlaps by less than, or equal to 10% with the CI of the unspecific endpoint. The compound is defined as hit and the CI of the specific endpoint overlaps by more than 10% with the CI of the unspecific endpoint. The compound is classified as a hit, if the concentration response curve generates a BMC and if the CI is within the test range. In case the CI spans above the test range, the compound is only classified as a hit, if the highest test concentration is significantly different from the lowest test concentration. The adjusted significance (p<0.05) is thereby determined using a Tukey HSD test. The decision process for the prediction model is described in the flow chart in Figure 5. Figure 5: Decision tree for the PM for down regulation applied for the test method NPC1. Overview of the decisions leading to the classification of a compound in one of four categories: “no hit”, “specific hit”, “borderline hit” and “unspecific hit”. Specific consideration for the prediction model: In case no confidence limits are available for the unspecific endpoint because the BMR is not reached, the BMCLus is assumed to be the highest tested concentration. If the CI of the specific endpoint additional spans above the test range for a compound identified as “hit” based on statistical significance, expert judgement is applied to define if the “hit” is specific or unspecific. Therefore, all datapoints of the unspecific and specific endpoint of the highest test concentration are compared. If these data points do not overlap, the compound is classified as “specific hit” otherwise as “unspecific hit”. In general, BMCs based on the same BMR are compared (e.g. BMC30us vs BMC30s). In case the BMC30us is not available for an endpoint that allows the generation of a BMC10us, the BMC10us is used instead. If the classification of this comparison is “unspecific hit”, the compound will be flagged as “check manually“ as the BMC10us is lower than the BMC30us leading to a higher probability of a false classification. To avoid such false classifications, expert judgment is needed. Compounds can also be flagged as “check manually”, if the classification, based on the viability is different from the classification based on the cytotoxicity and if the confidence interval is very wide (BMCU/BMCL > 25), which means a high uncertainty for the BMC estimation. In both cases expert judgment is needed to decide on the classification. The expert judgement is an individual decision process that accounts for effect size, curve progression, statistical significance and overall standard deviation. If the concentration response curves do not give enough information for decision by expert judgement, additional testing or testing in a different concentration range should be performed. PM upregulation In contrast to the PM for downregulation, the PM for upregulation is based on a hit definition without the comparison of confidence intervals (CI) between the specific and unspecific endpoint. The reason is, that specific and unspecific endpoints do not have the same relationship during an induction, compared to a reduction in the endpoint. A loss in general cell health will likely result in an effect on cell proliferation, while an induction in cell health (measured as mitochondrial activity) does not necessarily increase cell proliferation. The following three hit classifications apply: “no hit” The compound is not defined as hit. “specific hit”: The compound is defined as hit and the effect is no artifact due to loss in cell health. The compound is defined as hit in only the unspecific endpoints. “unspecific hit” The compound is classified as hit, if the concentration response curve generates a BMC and if the CI is within the test range. In case the CI spans above the test range, the compound is only classified as hit, if the highest test concentration is significantly different from the lowest test concentration. The adjusted significance (p<0.05) is thereby determined using a Tukey HSD test. The decision process for the prediction model is described in the flow chart in Figure 6. Figure 6: Decision tree for the PM for upregulation applied for the test method NPC1. Overview of the decisions leading to the classification of a compound in one of three categories: “no hit”, “specific hit”, and “unspecific hit”. In case a compound is classified as hit together with a reduction in an unspecific endpoint, it needs to be clarified if the induction is a specific effect or an artifact, due to a loss in cell viability or an increase in cytotoxicity. Therefore, expert judgement is applied, which accounts for effect size, curve progression, statistical significance, overall standard deviation but also morphological changes of the spheres. Expert judgement is additionally applied, if the confidence interval is very wide (BMCU/BMCL > 25) which means a high uncertainty for the BMC estimation.",Medium,"The answer provides a detailed description of the prediction models for both downregulation and upregulation, including hit classifications and decision processes. However, it lacks specific statistical details such as threshold values, variance, and the rationale for these thresholds. The explanation is complex and may not be fully clear without additional context or figures referenced in the text. The limitations of the prediction model are mentioned but not elaborated upon, and the toxicological rationale is not explicitly addressed.","(i) For dichotomized data the prediction model is based on comparing the concentration–response–derived benchmark concentrations (BMCs) for the DNT‐specific endpoints (proliferation by area or BrdU, with a benchmark response [BMR] set at 30% change, i.e. BMR30) to those for the unspecific endpoints (cytotoxicity and viability, where for cytotoxicity a BMR10 is used and for viability a BMR30). In the downregulation model, if the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the specific endpoint (BMCs) does not overlap with that of the unspecific endpoint (BMCus) – more precisely, if the upper CI of the specific endpoint falls below the lower CI of the unspecific endpoint – the test result is considered “toxic” (a “specific hit”). If there is no statistically significant difference or if the CIs overlap substantially, the compound is not considered toxic (or is flagged as “no hit” or “unspecific hit” depending on the amount of overlap). A “borderline hit” is defined when the overlap is minimal (≤10% overlap between the CIs) _(Sources: NPC1.pdf pp. 115–117)_.

(ii) For pseudo‐dichotomized outcomes—that is, when there are two clear classes and one borderline class in between—the borderline range is defined by a narrow overlap (≤10%) between the CI of the specific (DNT-related) endpoint and that of the unspecific endpoints. In this case, compounds falling into this marginal zone are not unequivocally toxic but warrant expert judgment before classification _(Sources: NPC1.pdf pp. 115–117)_.

(iii) For multi-class or continuous outcomes, the effect size is determined continuously by fitting concentration–response curves. The BMR is set using a predefined change relative to the baseline (e.g. 30% for proliferation endpoints and viability, 10% for cytotoxicity) that exceeds the inherent variability of the assay. The rationale behind choosing a BMR30 (or BMR10 for cytotoxicity) is twofold: mathematically, it has to be above the general baseline noise (i.e. the natural variability, often quantified in the assay by the coefficient of variation in the solvent controls) and biologically, a 30% change in proliferation or viability is considered relevant for indicating an adverse effect on a key neurodevelopmental process. This threshold setting is toxicologically justified because even a moderate change in proliferation (e.g. a 30% decrease) may have severe implications for brain development, whereas cytotoxicity is expected to impact cells only with a smaller effect threshold (BMR10) _(Sources: NPC1.pdf pp. 115, 117)_.

Limitations of the prediction model include the inherent biological variability of primary human neural progenitor cells, inter‐experimental differences (especially prior to normalization), and situations where the confidence interval spans a wide range (BMCU/BMCL >25) or extends above the test range. In such cases, the model requires additional expert judgment to decide on the hit’s specificity. Moreover, the assay addresses only proliferation as one neurodevelopmental endpoint, so potential hits affecting other processes (e.g. differentiation, migration) might be missed or require testing in an integrated battery of assays.

In screening mode, a “hit” is defined when the concentration–response curve produces a statistically valid BMC (with the corresponding CI within the test range) and when the statistical significance (e.g. via a Tukey HSD test, p<0.05) is met between the highest and lowest test concentrations. Depending on how the CIs of the test-specific and unspecific endpoints compare, the hit may be further categorized as a specific, borderline, or unspecific hit _(Sources: NPC1.pdf pp. 115–117)_.

In the case of high uncertainty in the confidence interval, (e.g. because the CI spans above the tested concentration range) the model additionally considers the statistical significance between the highest and the lowest test concentrations. Next to the hit definition, the uncertainty given by the 95 % CI is also considered in the specificity analyses (see 8.2 for a more detailed description). The model has been tested on a set of 17 DNT negative- and 9 DNT positive compounds (see 5.6 and 5.7). All negative compounds were correctly classified as “no hit” and 3 positive compounds were correctly classified as “specific hit” for DNT.",Medium,"The answer provides some information about the prediction model setup, including the use of 95% confidence intervals and statistical significance for hit definition. It mentions the test set of chemicals (17 DNT negative and 9 DNT positive compounds) and provides some results. However, it lacks details on the classifiers/statistical approaches used, documentation/publication references, and how the model handles changes to both sides of controls or interprets data in the opposite direction. The answer is partially complete but lacks clarity and comprehensiveness in addressing all aspects of the question.","The prediction model for the NPC1 assay was implemented as a statistical model using concentration–response data from the assay endpoints. In practice (for PM downregulation), several nonlinear models are fitted to the data (using the drc R package with model selection based on Akaike’s information criterion), and the model uses the 95% confidence intervals around the fitted concentration–response curve (i.e. the Benchmark Concentration, BMC, with its upper and lower limits) to define a hit by comparing the response of the specific (proliferation) endpoint and the unspecific (cytotoxicity/viability) endpoint. For example, a “specific hit” is defined when the CI for the specific endpoint does not overlap with that for the unspecific endpoint (with classifications “no hit”, “specific hit”, “borderline hit”, and “unspecific hit”). For PM upregulation (the response in the opposite direction) the approach is slightly different: no direct CI comparison is performed because induction in cell health does not automatically translate into increased proliferation. Instead, three hit classifications are used and additional expert judgement is applied especially if an unspecific endpoint is also affected.

Regarding the test set used for evaluating the prediction model, the model has been “tested” on a set of compounds consisting of 17 DNT‐negative and 9 DNT‐positive chemicals (i.e. n = 26 compounds in total), as reported by Masjosthusmann et al. (2020) and Blum et al. (2023). The documents do not list every individual chemical in that set, but note that for other assay controls the positive controls include compounds such as cadmium chloride, dexamethasone, hexachlorophene, chlorpromazine hydrochloride, methylazoxymethanol acetate, all‑trans retinoic acid, tributyltin chloride, and sodium valproate.

Because two separate prediction models are applied—one for downregulation and one for upregulation—the prediction model does cover both sides of a control. However, the decision rules differ between these directions. For downregulation, a hit is defined based on the confidence interval comparison between the DNT‐specific endpoint and unspecific endpoints. For upregulation, the hit definition does not rely on a direct CI comparison between endpoints (due to the different relationships) and uses a three‐category scheme, with additional expert evaluation to interpret cases where effects in measures like viability might be secondary to general cell health losses rather than a direct proliferative effect. In other words, thresholds, classification rules, and performance characteristics are defined separately for decreases versus increases.

The process—including the model setup, statistical fitting routines (using nonlinear regression, Tukey HSD for significance testing when CIs span above the test range, etc.), and evaluation of hit classification—has been documented in publications (e.g., Masjosthusmann et al., 2020; Blum et al., 2023).

Inter-experimental variation (raw) is the variability as CV between the raw SC across all independent experiments (n>360) before normalization. Inter-experimental variation (low conc.) is the variability as CV across all independent experiments (n>390) after normalization based on the response of the lowest test concentration. It is assumed that the lowest test concentration does not affect any of the endpoints measured. Inter-experimental variation (positive controls) is the variability of the positive control across all independent experiments (n>360) after normalization. For further detail, see Fig. 7. Positive control: proliferation media without growth factors (EGF, FGF) Table 1 summarizes the assay performance in terms of variability of each endpoint in the assay. This variability spans different individuals where cells were derived from. Table 1: Assay variability quantified as CV. Inter-experimental variation (positive controls) is only given for specific endpoints. Sensitivity and specificity of the NPC1 assay are determined based on a set of 9 predicted human DNT positive compounds and 17 predicted human DNT negative compounds (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020; Blum et al., 2023). Based on this compound set the following performance parameters are obtained for the NPC1 assay. Specificity: 100 % Sensitivity: 33% Here, it is important to mention, that it is not expected that the NPC1 assay identifies all DNT positive compounds as not all of those compounds act via an effect on cell proliferation on the developing brain.

 • This specificity is determined by comparing the concentration–response curves of the DNT‐specific endpoints (proliferation by area or BrdU incorporation) with unspecific endpoints (cytotoxicity/viability) using a prediction model that compares the confidence intervals of benchmark concentrations (BMCs). If the confidence intervals do not overlap (i.e. the BMC for the specific endpoint is well separated from the unspecific endpoint), a compound is classified as a “specific hit.”  
  _(Source: NPC1.pdf, Sensitivity and Specificity section, pp. 120–121)_

5. Sensitivity of the test method:  
 • The published sensitivity is 33% (i.e. only 33% of known DNT-positive compounds produced a positive readout in this proliferation assay).  
 • This sensitivity was determined by testing nine DNT-positive compounds using the assay and comparing the observed effects against the prediction model.  
  _(Source: NPC1.pdf, Sensitivity and Specificity section, pp. 120–121)_

6. Measures and determination of uncertainty:  
 • The uncertainty is estimated by the width of the 95% confidence intervals (CI) around the benchmark concentration (BMC) derived from concentration–response curve fitting.  
 • Uncertainty is also reflected in the intra- and inter-experimental CV values, as well as the prediction bands (using the R package drc) that are applied to derive upper (BMCU) and lower (BMCL) confidence limits.  
  _(Source: NPC1.pdf, Data processing and curve fitting sections, pp. 114–116)_

7. Detection limit / required change of endpoint:  
 • For proliferation endpoints, a Benchmark Response (BMR) of 30% change is used (i.e. a 30% increase or decrease in the endpoint is required to be considered measurable), whereas for cytotoxicity the BMR is set at 10%.  
 • No explicit numeric values for limit of detection (LOD) or limit of quantification (LOQ) are provided.  
  _(Source: NPC1.pdf, BMR definitions, pp. 115)_

8. Inter-operator variations:  
 • The document states that while the method has been used by multiple operators during an 18-month period, the inter-operator variability has not been determined.  
  _(Source: NPC1.pdf, Test method transferability section)_

9. Historical controls:  
 • The assay performance parameters are based on large data sets; for instance, intra-experimental variability is derived from over 350 experiments, and inter-experimental variability from over 360 experiments. This indicates that there is extensive historical control data available over a longer time period.

"Which compounds is the test likely to pick up correctly, where is it likely to fail? How does the test method react to mixtures and UVCBs? Are there areas (according to industry sector, compound chemistry, physical-chemical properties) that need to be excluded from testing, or that are particularly suitable? Which compound class cannot be detected (e.g. neurotransmitters for which the receptors are not expressed, endocrine disruptors in absence of respective pathway)? Are any compounds known to interfere with the test system (e.g. fluorescent or colored chemicals)?","Toxicological applicability domain The following compound classes have been tested successfully: - Industrial chemicals - pesticides and biocides - cosmetics ingredients - pharmaceuticals Compounds need to be soluble in a solvent at a solubility where the solvent does not produce effects by itself in the test system (see 0 for established solvents). Compounds that are volatile or have a high lipophilicity have not been tested and might need more sophisticated exposure methods such as ‘passive dosing’. Biological applicability domain Neural progenitor cell proliferation is based on primary hNPC obtained from the fetal human cortex. As mentioned in 0 “Scientific principle” the method represents NPC proliferation during the fetal period. Next to the endpoints represented by this test method, there are several other necessary neurodevelopmental endpoints which need to be studied using other test methods. Neurodevelopmental processes not represented by this test method: Neural Crest Cell (NCC) Migration NPC apoptosis Neuronal migration Oligodendrocyte migration Radial glia migration Neuronal differentiation Oligodendrocyte differentiation Neuronal morphology Synaptogenesis Neuronal network formation Neural Rosette Formation hiPSC-derived NPC proliferation hiPSC-NPC neuronal differentiation Neuronal subtype differentiation Astrocyte Differentiation and Maturation Astrocyte Reactivity Microglia reactivity Myelination For a complete assessment of developmental neurotoxicity, the test method needs to be part of a test battery. The information on signaling pathways modulating the neurodevelopmental endpoints of the test method is summarized in Table 2. This describes the so far tested biological application domain of the assay. Table 2: Signaling pathways studied in the test method. EGF(R): epidermal growth factor (receptor); CREB: cAMP-response element; COX-2: cyclooxygenase-2; PDGFR: platelet-derived growth factor; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; RAR: retinoic acid receptor; GR: glucocorticoid receptor; PKC: protein kinase C; Bis-I: Bisindolylmaleimide I.",Medium,"The answer provides some relevant information about the types of compounds that have been successfully tested and those that may require special consideration, such as volatile or highly lipophilic compounds. It also mentions the need for compounds to be soluble in certain solvents. However, it lacks specific details on how the test method reacts to mixtures and UVCBs, and does not clearly identify any compounds known to interfere with the test system. Additionally, while it lists several neurodevelopmental processes not represented by the test method, it does not directly address which compound classes cannot be detected or any specific areas that need to be excluded from testing.","Based on the NPC1 description, the assay reliably detects chemicals that interfere with fetal human neural progenitor cell proliferation. In practice, the assay correctly “picks up” compounds known to affect proliferation, for example, those on the positive‐control list such as cadmium chloride, dexamethasone, hexachlorophene, chlorpromazine hydrochloride, methylazoxymethanol acetate, all‑trans retinoic acid, tributyltin chloride, and sodium valproate (which have been shown to reduce proliferation when growth factors are removed) (Source: NPC1.pdf).

However, the assay is expected to “fail” to detect chemicals whose adverse effects on neurodevelopment are not mediated by a change in proliferation. For example, many developmental neurotoxicants act via effects on differentiation (neuronal or glial markers), migration or synaptogenesis. In addition, endocrine disruptors or chemicals acting via pathways that are not part of the signaling repertoire of these proliferating cells (for instance, compounds acting via receptors or pathways that are absent or not functional in these hNPCs) will not be captured by this test method (Source: NPC1.pdf).

Regarding mixtures and UVCBs, the documents do not provide explicit data or discussion on how the assay responds to complex mixtures or substances of unknown or variable composition (UVCBs). In the absence of specific guidance, it is likely that additional validation work would be needed when testing mixtures or UVCBs (Source: NPC1.pdf).

Concerning applicability relative to compound chemistry and physical–chemical properties, several areas are highlighted as potential issues. Compounds that are volatile, have high lipophilicity (high K_OW), or have poor solubility in the established solvents may be problematic and could require alternative dosing techniques (e.g., passive dosing) or may need to be excluded from testing. Additionally, compounds with intrinsic fluorescence or color can interfere with the fluorescence– and luminescence-based readouts for viability and cytotoxicity (Source: NPC1.pdf).

Finally, because the assay is designed as a proliferation endpoint it does not capture effects mediated by neurotransmitters (for which the corresponding receptors may not be expressed on the hNPCs) or endocrine disruptors acting via receptor‑mediated hormonal pathways that are absent from the test system. In sum, while the assay is well suited for industrial chemicals, pesticides, cosmetics ingredients, and many pharmaceuticals that affect cell proliferation, it is not suitable for chemicals whose mode-of-action does not involve proliferation or that interfere with the assay’s fluorescence/luminescence readouts (Source: NPC1.pdf).",0.7601295511611894,0.1540965884923935,0.1124153882265091,0.13638536632061005

The test method is currently used in the set-up of a DNT test battery.",Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by indicating that the test is part of a developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) test battery and can be used as a stand-alone method. However, it lacks details on potential strengths and weaknesses, comparison to similar tests, gaps it fills in the battery, and whether it should be used in the first or later tiers. The answer is incomplete and lacks clarity on several aspects of the question.","Based on the information in NPC1.pdf, the assay is designed to be used as one component of an in vitro developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) test battery. It specifically assesses fetal neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation and is intended to fill the gap of directly measuring proliferation in a human, 3D, fetal brain‐derived test system. Although it can be used as a stand‐alone method for evaluating proliferation, the assay does not capture other neurodevelopmental processes such as neuronal differentiation, migration, synaptogenesis, and network formation. Therefore, it is recommended that the NPC1 assay be incorporated into a DNT battery where complementary assays cover these additional endpoints.

Strengths and weaknesses in a battery context include:

• Strengths:  
 – Uses primary human NPCs formed as 3D spheres, which more closely mimic the in vivo situation of the developing brain.  
 – Implements two primary endpoints (sphere area and BrdU incorporation) along with secondary endpoints (viability and cytotoxicity), offering mechanistic insight (e.g., via growth factor–dependent proliferation and EGFR signaling).  
 – High specificity (100%) but moderate sensitivity (33%), making it particularly useful as a confirmatory or alert assay for agents that interfere with NPC proliferation.  
 – The assay has medium throughput and can be automated, making it suited for screening a moderate number of compounds.

• Weaknesses:  
 – The sensitivity is limited because not all DNT-positive compounds impact proliferation.  
 – It does not capture other key neurodevelopmental processes (for example, differentiation or migration), so additional assays are required for a full hazard assessment.

In summary, while the NPC1 assay can serve as a stand-alone test for assessing specific proliferation endpoints, it is best positioned in the first tier of a DNT battery as one of several complementary assays. Its strengths lie in its mechanistic relevance and specificity; however, for a comprehensive evaluation of developmental neurotoxicity, it should be used alongside other tests that cover endpoints not protected by this assay.

It also does not prioritize the publications or comment on the types of information they provide, which are key components of the question.","Below is a summary answer based solely on the NPC1.pdf context:

1. Deviations from published descriptions  
 • The current version (20230310_v2) notes changes “according to comments” compared to earlier descriptions. This includes “minor modifications” such as the following examples:  
  – The use of poly‑Hema coated 96‑well U‑bottom plates for plating single spheres (0.25–0.35 mm diameter) rather than any previous plate type, which might have been specified differently in earlier protocols.  
  – The cell number per well is now defined by placing one nearly round neurosphere (≈300 µm diameter, containing roughly 2.6 × 10³ cells) per well; previous descriptions may have used different sphere sizes or cell seeding numbers.  
  – Endpoint measurements include two complementary readouts: one based on bright‑field imaging to determine sphere area (NPC1a) and another based on BrdU incorporation measured by luminescence (NPC1b). In earlier publications, each endpoint was already described but the adaptation of imaging time points (0, 24, 48, and 72 hours) and exposure times (BrdU added in the last 16 hours) represents a procedural fine‑tuning.  
  – Timing of compound exposure over 72 h with daily assessments is maintained; however, any deviation such as the exact timing of media exchanges, use of FGF added immediately prior to thawing, or specific adjustments in mechanical dissociation (e.g. sphere edge size between 0.15–0.25 mm) reflect refinements based on operator feedback and are mentioned as “changes according to comments.”  
 These details show that while the scientific principle remains the same as described in earlier publications, the current standard operating procedure includes refinements regarding consumables (e.g., plate type), cell handling, and endpoint acquisition.

2. Most relevant publications with comprehensive overviews  
 (a) For a detailed description of the test system (i.e. primary human neural progenitor cells obtained from fetal brain cortex), the following publication is central:

It also covers details on the statistical evaluation (e.g. benchmark concentration analysis) and the integration of the assay into a broader in vitro testing battery.  
 (b) For a detailed description of the test method (i.e. NPC1 assay for assessing proliferation) the following are particularly relevant:  
  – Koch et al. (2022): This publication documents scientific validation of the hNPC proliferation assay, including details on marker profiles (nestin, SOX2, Ki67), endpoint rationale (brightfield imaging vs. BrdU incorporation), and the influence of growth factor signaling on proliferation.

It only references sections without detailing how the system reflects human biology or relevant tissue organization. The response lacks clarity and completeness in addressing the question.,"The assay’s mechanistic validation is supported by two lines of evidence:

1. Omics analysis has been applied to characterize the test system. Transcriptomic profiling of proliferating, three‐day differentiated, and five‐day differentiated hNPCs identified key neurodevelopmental processes (e.g., neuronal and glial differentiation, migration) and elucidated the roles of signaling pathways such as BMP, Notch, and EGF. This omics approach confirms that the cells, derived from fetal human cortex and cultured as 3D neurospheres, express molecular signatures reflective of in vivo neurodevelopment.

2. Endpoint‐specific controls (mechanistic control compounds, MCC) are used to demonstrate the system’s responsiveness to perturbations of relevant signaling. For example, the positive control for the primary endpoints involves the withdrawal of growth factors (EGF and FGF), which markedly reduces hNPC proliferation. This validates that the assay’s readouts rely on growth factor‐dependent signaling—mirroring physiological regulation in the developing brain.

Together, these approaches confirm that the assay reflects human biology and tissue organization relevant to developmental neurotoxicity. The use of primary human neural progenitor cells in a 3D configuration further supports the resemblance of the in vitro system to fetal brain tissue, including proper expression of neural markers (e.g., nestin, SOX2) and the regulation of proliferation through growth factors and related signaling pathways.

"Are special permits (e.g. genetic work, stem cells, radioactivity, etc.) required? Are special facilities required? Is special ethical approval necessary (indicate approval document).",No specific facilities are required. No specific ethical approval is required.,Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by stating that no specific facilities or ethical approval are required. However, it does not address whether special permits are needed, leaving the response incomplete.","No special permits (e.g., for genetic work, stem cells, or radioactivity) or dedicated facilities are required, and no specific ethical approval is necessary to conduct this assay.

"List elements of the test method (e.g. consumables, chemicals, analytical methods, equipment) that are protected by patents or any other means. Indicate the type of protection and where the element (or license for it) may be obtained.",There are no commercial aspects or intellectual properties to be considered.,Medium,"The answer partially addresses the question by stating that there are no commercial aspects or intellectual properties to consider. However, it lacks clarity and completeness as it does not explicitly list elements of the test method or indicate the type of protection and where elements or licenses may be obtained, even if the answer is 'none'.","None of the consumables, chemicals, analytical methods, or pieces of equipment described in the NPC1 assay are reported to be protected by patents or subject to other intellectual property rights. In fact, the document explicitly states that “there are no commercial aspects or intellectual properties to be considered” for material or procedures used in the assay. The source cells are obtained from Lonza, which provides them under donor consent and legal authorization allowing their use in research, but no additional patented protection is applied to the assay elements or related consumables.
