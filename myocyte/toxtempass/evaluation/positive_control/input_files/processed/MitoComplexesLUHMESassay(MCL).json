(8.1) Which test system and readout(s) are used?

(8.1; 8.6) Does the test method capture an endpoint of current regulatory studies? (9.5) If the method has undergone some form of validation/evaluation, give its status. (9.4)",
          "answer": "This in vitro test method is based on human neurons (LUHMES cells) at the proliferative precursor stage. Is assesses disturbances in the activity of the mitochondrial complexes (cI, cII, cIII, cIV) by exposure to toxicants. The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) is measured using a Seahorse XF Analyzer. The activity of the four individual complexes is determined. The data of this method are meant to predict (a) functional impairment of mitochondria and (b) the mechanism of action of mitochondrial toxicants. The method has not undergone formal validation and has not been part of a ring trial. It predicts some aspects of neurotoxicity, but not all aspects covered by an in vivo neurotoxicity study (TG424).",

Organoids and microphysiological systems (MPS) may need some special/additional considerations as detailed in Pamies et al. (2018) and Marx et al.

The assay described in here is based on UKN (University of Konstanz) LUHMES cells.  Origin: mesencephalon of an 8 week old human fetus, subclone of the tetracycline-controlled, v-myc-overexpressing human mesencephalic-derived cell line MESC2.10. MESC2.10 has been conditionally immortalized with a LINX v-myc retroviral vector with a tet-off system.  Gender: female  Morphology: upon differentiation, cells form neuronal network, see figure below  Doubling time: approx. 14 -20 h (depending on passage)  Phenotype: Dopaminergic (DA)-phenotype; tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression depends on the presence of cAMP in the culture medium. Under differentiation conditions, cells extend neurites after 24h. They display extensive growth cones, but synapse formation is not clear. After 6 days of differentiation, cells express voltage-dependent ion channels and show electrical activity.  Expression: Cells express α-synuclein (Parkinson’s disease) (Schildknecht et al., 2013), all standard synaptic proteins and all proteins required for AD (Alzheimer’s disease) pathology (Aβ- formation, Tau hyperphosphorylation)(Scholz et al., 2013; Scholz et al., 2018). Conversion of proliferating LUHMES cells into post-mitotic neurons. LUHMES were grown and differentiated either on glass cover slips or in multi-well plates. Cells were either fixed for microscopy or lysed for RNA extraction at different stages between day 0 and day 10 (d0–d10). (a) Schematic representation of the 2-step differentiation procedure, initiated by the absence of the cytokine basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and addition of tetracycline. Unless mentioned otherwise, dibutyryl cAMP (cAMP) and glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) were present throughout the differentiation. (b) Representative scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of undifferentiated (d0) and differentiated (d5) LUHMES with marked squares shown at higher magnification. (c) LUHMES were immunostained on d0 and d5 for bIII-tubulin and nuclei were labeled by DNA staining with H-33341 dye. The mRNA expression levels of bIII-tubulin, Fox-3/NeuN and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) were determined after different days of maturation by RT-qPCR. (d) The proliferative status of d0 and d5 cells was quantified by immunostaining of Ki-67, H3S10P and Fox-3/NeuN. It is indicated as percentage of positive nuclei relative to all nuclei, as identified by DNA staining with H-33342.

Proliferating LUHMES cells were seeded at a density of 60,000 cells/well in proliferation medium 1 day prior to the experiment. Shortly before the assay, the cells were permeabilised by replacing the medium with MAS-buffer freshly supplemented with ADP and digitonin. The basal OCR was recorded before the substance of interest was injected. Then, a sequence of MRC complex substrates and inhibitors was added to determine cI-cIV activity. All OCR measurements were normalized to the respective basal OCR. For each complex, the normalized OCR under treated conditions was normalized to the control to calculate the modified complex activity. In tier 1, cI substrates paired with the cII inhibitor were added first to determine cI activity. Secondly, the cIII substrate and the cI inhibitor were injected to assess cIII activity. In tier 2, the first injection consisted of the cII substrate and the cI inhibitor, it allowed the quantification of cII activity. The second injection of cIV substrates paired with the cII inhibitor permitted the quantification of cIV activity.
