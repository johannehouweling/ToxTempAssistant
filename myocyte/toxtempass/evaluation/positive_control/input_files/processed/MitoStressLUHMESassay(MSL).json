          "answer": "This in vitro test method is based on human neurons (LUHMES cells) at a stage of neurite growth. It assesses disturbances in (a) the mitochondrial respiration in general, and (b) individual mitochondrial parameters, by exposure to toxicants. The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) are measured simultaneously using a Seahorse XF Analyzer. Basal respiration, acute response to test compound, ATP production-coupled respiration, proton leak, maximal respiration, respiratory spare capacity and non-mitochondrial respiration are determined. The data of this method are meant to predict functional impairment of mitochondria. The method has not undergone formal validation and has not been part of a ring trial. It predicts some aspects of neurotoxicity, but not all aspects covered by an in vivo neurotoxicity study (TG424).",

Organoids and microphysiological systems (MPS) may need some special/additional considerations as detailed in Pamies et al. (2018) and Marx et al.

The assay described in here is based on UKN (University of Konstanz) LUHMES cells.  Origin: mesencephalon of an 8 week old human fetus, subclone of the tetracycline-controlled, v-myc-overexpressing human mesencephalic-derived cell line MESC2.10. MESC2.10 has been conditionally immortalized with a LINX v-myc retroviral vector with a tet-off system.  Gender: female  Morphology: upon differentiation, cells form neuronal network, see figure below  Doubling time: approx. 14 -20 h (depending on passage)  Phenotype: Dopaminergic (DA)-phenotype; tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression depends on the presence of cAMP in the culture medium. Under differentiation conditions, cells extend neurites after 24h. They display extensive growth cones, but synapse formation is not clear. After 6 days of differentiation, cells express voltage-dependent ion channels and show electrical activity.  Expression: Cells express α-synuclein (Parkinson’s disease) (Schildknecht et al., 2013), all standard synaptic proteins and all proteins required for AD (Alzheimer’s disease) pathology (Aβ- formation, Tau hyperphosphorylation)(Scholz et al., 2013; Scholz et al., 2018). Conversion of proliferating LUHMES cells into post-mitotic neurons. LUHMES were grown and differentiated either on glass cover slips or in multi-well plates. Cells were either fixed for microscopy or lysed for RNA extraction at different stages between day 0 and day 10 (d0–d10). (a) Schematic representation of the 2-step differentiation procedure, initiated by the absence of the cytokine basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and addition of tetracycline. Unless mentioned otherwise, dibutyryl cAMP (cAMP) and glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) were present throughout the differentiation. (b) Representative scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of undifferentiated (d0) and differentiated (d5) LUHMES with marked squares shown at higher magnification. (c) LUHMES were immunostained on d0 and d5 for bIII-tubulin and nuclei were labeled by DNA staining with H-33341 dye. The mRNA expression levels of bIII-tubulin, Fox-3/NeuN and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) were determined after different days of maturation by RT-qPCR. (d) The proliferative status of d0 and d5 cells was quantified by immunostaining of Ki-67, H3S10P and Fox-3/NeuN. It is indicated as percentage of positive nuclei relative to all nuclei, as identified by DNA staining with H-33342.

Which functional parameters (e.g. certain biological responses to reference substances) are important? For iPSC maintenance: How do you control pluripotency? How stable are your cells over several passages? Which passage(s) are valid? For primary cells: Show stability and identity of supply; demonstrate stability of function (e.g. xenobiotic metabolism).

As in 3.3., special/additional requirements apply to genetically-modified cells and microphysiological systems.",

Cells of the working stock are checked for marker gene expression once the stock is created, but not every thawed cell batch is checked. There only visual inspection is done. The cells should be of oval morphology, and should not form extensive aggregates and clustering. Approx. 5- 10% of cell death (dead cells floating in flask) is considered normal, increased cell death one passage after thawing justifies to discard of the cell batch.

Cell seeding and medium change should be performed as fast as possible to keep cells as short as possible at room temperature. Furthermore, only 2 wells should be aspirated and refilled at once on day 3.
