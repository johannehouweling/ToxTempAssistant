(8.1) Which test system and readout(s) are used? (4.1; 5.2) Which biological process(es) (e.g. neurite outgrowth, differentiation) and/or toxicological events (e.g. oxidative stress, cell death) are modelled/reflected by your test method?

          "answer": "This in vitro test method is based on human iPSC-derived immature dorsal root ganglia (iDRG) neurons at a stage of neurite growth. It assesses (a) disturbances in the development of the (peripheral) nervous system, and (b) direct damage to the peripheral nervous system, by exposure to toxicants. The neurite area (which serves as indirect measurement of neuronal interconnectivity) of stained differentiating neurons, as well as cellular viability are measured simultaneously using high content imaging. The processes of neurite outgrowth and cell death are measured. The data of this method are meant to predict (a) developmental disorders in children caused by compound exposure during fetal development, and (b) damage to the developed nervous system, in particular to the peripheral nervous system. The method has not undergone formal validation and has not been part of a ring trial. It predicts some aspects of neurotoxicity, but not all aspects covered by an in vivo neurotoxicity study (TG424). It has been used in the screening of medium-sized compound libraries, has undergone some mechanistic evaluation, and has been linked to AOP-279 (AOPwiki ID) / ETR09N (EU-ToxRisk AOP task ID) (Peripheral neuropathy caused by microtubule interacting drugs). According to the readiness criteria as published by Bal-Price et al. (2018) the PeriTox assay obtained the readiness score A-.",

          "answer": "Quantification of neurite outgrowth An automated microplate reading microscope (Array-ScanII HCS Reader, Cellomics, PA) equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera (resolution 1024 x 1024; run at 2 x 2 binning) was used for image acquisition. Ten fields per well were imaged. Images were recorded in 2 channels using a 20x objective and excitation/emission wavelengths of 365 ± 50/535 ± 45 to detect H-33342 in channel 1 and 474 ± 40/535 ± 45 to detect calcein in channel 2. In both channels, a fixed exposure time and an intensity histogram-derived threshold were used for object identification. Neurite pixels were identified using the following image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified as objects in channel 1 according to their size, area, shape, and intensity which were predefined on untreated cells using a machine-based learning algorithm, and manual selection of nuclei to be classified as intact. The nuclear outlines were expanded by 3.2 µm in each direction, to define a virtual cell soma area (VCSA) based on the following procedure: The average width of the cytoplasm ring (distance nucleus - cell membrane) of LUHMES cells was experimentally determined to be 2.3 µm. Size irregularities were not always due to growing neurites, as determined by combined F-actin/tubulin beta-III staining. To avoid scoring of false positive neurite areas, the exclusion ring (VCSA) was made bigger than the average cell size. Then, we used two control compounds (U0126 and bisindolylmaleimid I) to vary the expanded outlines from 0.6 to 4 µm. We found 3.2 µm to be optimal both to detect neurite growth over time and to identify reduced neurite growth with high sensitivity. All calcein-positive pixels of the field (beyond a given intensity threshold) were defined as viable cellular structures (VCSs). The threshold was dynamically determined for each field after flat field and background correction and intensity normalization to 512 gray values and was set to 12% of the maximal brightness (channel 63 of 512). The VCS defines the sum of all somata and neurites without their assignment to individual cells. In an automatic calculation, the VCSAs, defined in the H- 33342 channel, were used as filter in the calcein channel and subtracted from the VCS. The remaining pixels (VCS - VCSA) in the calcein channel were defined as neurite area. Quantification of individual viable cells by imaging For a quantitative assessment of viable cells, the same images used to assess neurite area were analyzed using another image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified in channel 1 as objects according to their size, area, shape, and intensity. Nuclei of apoptotic cells with increased fluorescence were excluded. A VCSA was defined around each nucleus by expanding it by 0.3 µm into each direction. Calcein-AM staining, labeling live cells, was detected in channel 2. The algorithm quantified the calcein intensity in the VCSA areas. Cells having an average calcein signal intensity in the VCSAs below a predefined threshold were classified by the program as “not viable”. Valid nuclei with a positive calcein signal in their cognate VCSA were counted as viable cells. A positive calcein signal was based on measurements of the average intensity (normal cells: 1300 ± 115, threshold: < 50) and the total integrated intensity (normal cells: 186,000 ± 23,600, threshold < 1000) of cells.",

The reason for updating the prediction model was that a decrease of 50% in neurite area and viability cannot always be achieved with our range of test concentrations but to reach an effect of 25% is more reasonable. The initial prediction model therefore often used EC50 values that were only based on a pure mathematical curve fit. However, the now used BMC25 is more related to the data that was practically obtained. The prediction model has been applied to screen 80 compound library of NTP (Delp et al., 2018).

Several performance parameters for the test were obtained in several separate evaluation rounds. A first evaluation was done during the first publication of the model and its applications (Hoelting et al. 2016). Here, a panel of well-selected positive and negative controls have been tested. Accordingly, the specificity was 100% and the sensitivity was > 90 %. In dedicated experiments, S/N ratios of > 20 and a z’ of > 0.5 have been determined. Operator reproducibility was shown in Hoelting et al. 2016 (Supplementary 3) for the compound colchicine. The test has been used in screening campaigns, and real-live performance data under broader screen conditions have been obtained. The different performance data need to be considered, when a compound is a hit in a screen, or whether it has been specifically evaluated in a hit follow-up or a mechanistic project. A first screen application has been the NTP80 screen (80 compounds provided by the US NTP). Data are published Delp et al. 2018.

Compare performance to similar tests. Which gaps in a known or potential battery does the test method fill? Should the test preferentially be used in the first tier or later tiers, are complementary assays required or is it a stand-alone method?",
          "answer": "a) Strengths:  Medium to high throughput  Automated microscopy b) compared to UKN4 (which quantifies neurite outgrowth of central neurons), UKN5 measures neurite outgrowth specifically of peripheral neurons. This was shown by treatment with MPP+ which is transported by the dopamine transporter (DAT) and had effect in UKN4, but not UKN5 as peripheral neurons which lack the DAT transporter. Furthermore, toxicants known to specifically induce peripheral neuropathies, like proteasome inhibitors (e.g. Bortezomib) or acrylamide were shown to have neurite specific effects in UKN5 but not in UKN4 (Hoelting et al. 2016) c) specific effects peripheral neurons.
