          "answer": "The human developing central nervous system may be more vulnerable to adverse effects of chemical agents  than the adult brain. At present, due to the knowledge gap concerning hazard identification for human  neurodevelopmental toxicity (DNT), there is an urgent need for testing and subsequent regulation of  chemicals for their potential to interfere with the developing nervous system. Primary human neural progenitor  cells (hNPCs) cultivated as three-dimensional floating spheres are able to represent several key processes  of brain development. In the neural progenitor cell proliferation assay (NPC1), hNPCs are plated in 96 well  plates as 3-dimensional spheres and exposed to test compounds. Thereby the process of NPC proliferation  can be studied. This DNT-specific endpoint is studied in combination with general cell viability and  cytotoxicity. Cortical human NPC proliferation is a critical process during brain development that, if disturbed,  may lead to alterations in brain development and cause cognitive dysfunction. Currently, cortical NPC  proliferation is one of the many processes, which are assessed in the OECD TG426 by neuropathological  evaluation of certain brain regions as well as neurobehavioral tests. According to the readiness criteria as  published by Bal-Price et al. (2018), the neural progenitor cell proliferation assay obtained the readiness  score A.",

Moreover, proliferating hNPCs react to growth factor stimuli (epidermal growth factor (EGF) and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor (FGF)) with increased proliferation, while simultaneous pharmacological inhibition of the EGF receptor (EGFR; PD153035) impaired the proliferation increase. Upon transfer of hNPC neurospheres on poly D-lysine/laminin matrix and cultivation in the absence of growth factors (EGF and FGF), the hNPCs differentiate into effector cells expressing markers of neurons (β-III- tubulin(TUBB3), astrocytes (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP)), radial glia cells (nestin) and oligodendrocytes (O4) (Baumann et al., 2015; Schmuck et al., 2017; Koch et al., 2022).",

          "answer": "The sphere size at day 0 of cell thawing can be different depending on the donor. In the 3- to 4-week expansion period different donors can show differences in their proliferative capacity (spheres need longer, 3 instead of 4 weeks, to reach the acceptable minimum size of 0.2 – 0.5 µm). After the first mechanical dissociation, there are no observable or measurable inter-individual differences. Critical consumables The proliferation medium does not contain serum or serum replacement. The use of EGF and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is critical for sphere growth. FGF contains 1% bovine serum albumin and is thus prone to batch effects. Critical handling The thawing medium contains DMSO in a concentration that affects cell health which is why thawed cells should quickly be diluted in proliferation medium (30 mL of media for one vial of cells). It is recommended to add FGF to the proliferation medium directly before thawing. At the end of week two of the expansion period (see below), the spheres should be transferred to petri dishes coated with poly-(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly-Hema) to prevent cell attachment. Attached cells that are not differentiated can be gently detached using a 1000 µL pipet. To avoid repeated attachment, all cells should be transferred to a new poly-Hema coated petri dish. Medium containing FGF should not be stored longer than 1 week at 4°C. During the first two weeks, the medium should be removed using a 1000 µL pipet to keep the accidental removal of small spheres to a minimum. In addition, removed medium should be kept in a new petri dish under culture conditions until the next feeding day, to transfer accidentally removed spheres back to the culture. The neurospheres should be well distributed in the petri dish to prevent aggregation. This is especially important after mechanical dissociations. It is important to avoid frequent re-opening of the incubators, to ensure constant CO2 and temperature levels. Furthermore, the smallest vibrations can lead to aggregations of neurospheres. The number of passages after thawing influences the proliferation capability of neurospheres. Neurospheres should not be used for the NPC1 assay after passage 6.",

The thawing is performed by repeated addition and removal of proliferation medium to the vial until all cells are transferred to a tissue culture flask containing proliferation medium. The cells are carefully resuspended and distributed to 10 cm petri dishes filled with fresh, prewarmed proliferation medium. The cells are fed by replacing half the medium with new medium every two to three days (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). At each feeding day, the culture is checked for impurities (e.g. fibers or other debris). Impurities and the removed media are transferred to a new petri dish (waste dish). If spheres are mistakenly sorted out during feeding, they can be rescued and placed back in the original culture dish. After 3-4 weeks, neurospheres reach the acceptable size of 0.2 – 0.5 mm for passaging by mechanical dissociation. Therefore, neurospheres are mechanically dissociated into pieces of 0.15 - 0.25 mm edge length (depending on the desired sphere size after passaging) using a tissue chopper, which then round-off again to uniform sized neurospheres within 1 day in proliferation medium. By using this method, neurospheres are expanded every week. Starting at week 2, poly-Hema coated dishes are used for the cultivation procedure. Figure 1 differentiation towards the final test system. hNPC are thawed by repeated addition and removal of proliferation media. The resuspended cells are distributed to cell culture dishes and cultivated in proliferation media containing EGF and FGF for three to four weeks with 50% media exchange every two to three days.

Between one to three days after passaging, depending on the size chosen for passaging, spheres at a size of 0.3 mm are used in the assay. For the assessment of neural progenitor cell proliferation, the spheres are plated in poly-Hema coated 96- well U-bottom plates filled with proliferation medium containing growth factors (EGF and FGF). One 0.25 - 0.35 mm big sphere is plated in the middle of each well. Within 3 days NPCs proliferate and grow in size. Cultivation during the test method is performed at 37°C and 5% CO2 at a pH of 7.2-7.6. As a positive control, spheres are cultivated in absence of growth factors (EGF and FGF), which dramatically reduces proliferation.",

Stock solutions in non-sterile solvents (e.g. water or PBS) have to be sterile filtrated using a sterile syringe filter (diameter = 0.2 µm). Adsorption to the filter needs to be considered. Stock solutions are aliquoted and stored at -20°C. A stock solution is not thawed more than three times. For the preparation of the test condition, the stock solution is diluted to the highest test concentration (default 1:1000) in proliferation medium. All following dilutions are prepared by serial dilution of the highest concentration in proliferation medium with solvent (in the concentration of the highest test concentration). The default serial dilution is 1:3 which covers a concentration range from e.g. 20 µM to 27 nM (729-fold). Depending on the desired concentration range, the dilution can be adjusted to 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, or other. The SC is prepared by adding the solvent to proliferation medium in the same concentration as the highest test concentration. 100 µL of the compound dilutions and the SC are added to each well of a 96 well plate (Figure 4). Alternatively, the serial dilution can be prepared directly in the 96 well plates. One hNPC sphere is added to each well after the medium equilibrated for 15 to 30 min at 37°C and 5% CO2. To subtract the background fluorescence of the phenol red-containing medium, 4 wells with medium only (Background, without cells, Figure 4) are prepared for the viability and cytotoxicity assays. Figure 4 Plating Scheme. The type of solvent control depends on the solvent of the compound that was tested. 7 compound concentrations (for each compound) are plated in a serial dilution from lowest (left) to highest (right) concentration. The positive control for cell proliferation is proliferation medium without EGF and FGF. BrdU background is used for the proliferation assay by BrdU (spheres in SC medium). Background and lysis control are used for cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. 2 different compounds can be investigated on one plate (blue and purple).",

Can you give uncertainty for non-cytotoxicity or no-effect? How do you handle non-monotonic curve shapes or other curve features that are hard to describe with the usual mathematical fit model?",
          "answer": "The data is normalized to the SC and re-normalized to the starting point of the curve. For the normalization to the SC the median of each replicate data point is normalized to the median of the SC in the respective experiment. For the cytotoxicity assays the following normalization is used instead of the normalization to the SC. Here again each response value is normalized using the median of the lysis control and the median of the solvent control. lysis control − response normalized response = lysis control − solvent control The R package drc is used to calculate the optimal fit for each experiment. For calculations of curve fits and BMCs, the data from independent experiments is pooled (median of all replicate values for one concentration). Several non-linear models are run with the concentration response data of each endpoint and the Akaike´s information criteria is used to determine the best fit. For re-normalization of the data, the response value of the curves starting point is determined and used to re-normalize all response values. Therefore, each mean response value is divided by the starting point of the curve and multiplied with 100. For the re-normalized response values the curve fitting is repeated to produce the final concentration response curve. For deriving a reference point (RP) or point of departure (Pod) the Benchmark Concentration (BMC) approach as recommended by the EFSA Scientific Committee (Hardy et al., 2017) is applied. The BMC approach makes use of all data points that define the fitted concentration response curve. Thereby, the BMC is defined as the concentration that is associated with a specific change in response, the Benchmark Response (BMR). The BMR is a value of effect size and should be defined as an effect size that is higher than the general variability of the measured endpoint. The BMR is therefore determined based on the variability of the respective endpoint. BMR for NPC1: proliferation by area BMR30 proliferation by BrdU BMR30 cytotoxicity 72 h BMR10 viability 72 h BMR30 Based on the BMR and the concentration response curve, the evaluation tool calculates the BMC, as well as upper and lower confidence limits (BMCU and BMCL respectively) based on the predict function in the R package drc. The predict function calculates the prediction bands around the concentration response curve based on the deviation between independent experiments and gives an estimation of the area that is expected to enclose 95% of future data points. The BMCL is thereby defined as the intersection of the lower band and the BMR while the BMCU is defined as the intersection of the upper band and the BMR. The confidence intervals are used to access the uncertainty of the BMC. If the BMCU is 1.5 times above the test range, the original BMCU is replaced by 1.5x the highest tested concentration.",

What is a ‘hit’ if the test is used in screening mode (= hit definition, if different from above)?",
          "answer": "Two prediction models (PM) are applied for the NPC1 assay. One PM for a downregulation (PM downregulation) and one PM for an upregulation (PM upregulation) in cell proliferation. PM downregulation The PM uses hit definition based on comparison of the confidence intervals (CI) for the BMC of the DNT- specific endpoint (BMCs) and the unspecific endpoint (cytotoxicity/viability; BMCus). Thereby the following four hit classifications apply: “no hit” “specific hit”: “borderline hit”: “unspecific hit” The compound is not defined as a hit. The compound is defined as hit and the CI’s do not overlap, meaning that the upper confidence limit of the specific endpoint (BMCUs) is lower than the lower confidence limit of the unspecific endpoint (BMCLus). The compound is defined as hit and the CI of the specific endpoint overlaps by less than, or equal to 10% with the CI of the unspecific endpoint. The compound is defined as hit and the CI of the specific endpoint overlaps by more than 10% with the CI of the unspecific endpoint. The compound is classified as a hit, if the concentration response curve generates a BMC and if the CI is within the test range. In case the CI spans above the test range, the compound is only classified as a hit, if the highest test concentration is significantly different from the lowest test concentration. The adjusted significance (p<0.05) is thereby determined using a Tukey HSD test. The decision process for the prediction model is described in the flow chart in Figure 5. Figure 5: Decision tree for the PM for down regulation applied for the test method NPC1. Overview of the decisions leading to the classification of a compound in one of four categories: “no hit”, “specific hit”, “borderline hit” and “unspecific hit”. Specific consideration for the prediction model: In case no confidence limits are available for the unspecific endpoint because the BMR is not reached, the BMCLus is assumed to be the highest tested concentration. If the CI of the specific endpoint additional spans above the test range for a compound identified as “hit” based on statistical significance, expert judgement is applied to define if the “hit” is specific or unspecific. Therefore, all datapoints of the unspecific and specific endpoint of the highest test concentration are compared. If these data points do not overlap, the compound is classified as “specific hit” otherwise as “unspecific hit”. In general, BMCs based on the same BMR are compared (e.g. BMC30us vs BMC30s). In case the BMC30us is not available for an endpoint that allows the generation of a BMC10us, the BMC10us is used instead. If the classification of this comparison is “unspecific hit”, the compound will be flagged as “check manually“ as the BMC10us is lower than the BMC30us leading to a higher probability of a false classification. To avoid such false classifications, expert judgment is needed. Compounds can also be flagged as “check manually”, if the classification, based on the viability is different from the classification based on the cytotoxicity and if the confidence interval is very wide (BMCU/BMCL > 25), which means a high uncertainty for the BMC estimation. In both cases expert judgment is needed to decide on the classification. The expert judgement is an individual decision process that accounts for effect size, curve progression, statistical significance and overall standard deviation. If the concentration response curves do not give enough information for decision by expert judgement, additional testing or testing in a different concentration range should be performed. PM upregulation In contrast to the PM for downregulation, the PM for upregulation is based on a hit definition without the comparison of confidence intervals (CI) between the specific and unspecific endpoint. The reason is, that specific and unspecific endpoints do not have the same relationship during an induction, compared to a reduction in the endpoint. A loss in general cell health will likely result in an effect on cell proliferation, while an induction in cell health (measured as mitochondrial activity) does not necessarily increase cell proliferation. The following three hit classifications apply: “no hit” The compound is not defined as hit. “specific hit”: The compound is defined as hit and the effect is no artifact due to loss in cell health. The compound is defined as hit in only the unspecific endpoints. “unspecific hit” The compound is classified as hit, if the concentration response curve generates a BMC and if the CI is within the test range. In case the CI spans above the test range, the compound is only classified as hit, if the highest test concentration is significantly different from the lowest test concentration. The adjusted significance (p<0.05) is thereby determined using a Tukey HSD test. The decision process for the prediction model is described in the flow chart in Figure 6. Figure 6: Decision tree for the PM for upregulation applied for the test method NPC1. Overview of the decisions leading to the classification of a compound in one of three categories: “no hit”, “specific hit”, and “unspecific hit”. In case a compound is classified as hit together with a reduction in an unspecific endpoint, it needs to be clarified if the induction is a specific effect or an artifact, due to a loss in cell viability or an increase in cytotoxicity. Therefore, expert judgement is applied, which accounts for effect size, curve progression, statistical significance, overall standard deviation but also morphological changes of the spheres. Expert judgement is additionally applied, if the confidence interval is very wide (BMCU/BMCL > 25) which means a high uncertainty for the BMC estimation.",

Has the prediction model been tested (what was the test set of chemicals)? List chemicals or give n, if n > 50. Is the process documented (publication)? Does the prediction model (PM) apply to changes to both sides of controls (up/down)? If the PM is one-sided (e.g. toxicants leading to a decrease vs. control), how are data in the opposite direction handled and interpreted? If the PM is two-sided, do different rules, characteristics and interpretations apply to the two sides (e.g. is a decrease in viability or an increase in viability both interpreted as an effect/toxicity; are thresholds and performance characteristics to both sides the same?).",
          "answer": "The prediction model is set up as a statistical model which uses the 95 % confidence intervals (assessed based on the prediction bands around the concentration response curve) to determine the uncertainty of a hit definition. In the case of high uncertainty in the confidence interval, (e.g. because the CI spans above the tested concentration range) the model additionally considers the statistical significance between the highest and the lowest test concentrations. Next to the hit definition, the uncertainty given by the 95 % CI is also considered in the specificity analyses (see 8.2 for a more detailed description). The model has been tested on a set of 17 DNT negative- and 9 DNT positive compounds (see 5.6 and 5.7). All negative compounds were correctly classified as “no hit” and 3 positive compounds were correctly classified as “specific hit” for DNT.",

          "answer": "The following parameters were assessed to quantify the assay variability: Intra-experimental variation (SC) is the mean coefficient of variation (CV) ± SD of the CV of all replicates of the solvent control from one experiment across all (n>350) experiments. Inter-experimental variation (raw) is the variability as CV between the raw SC across all independent experiments (n>360) before normalization. Inter-experimental variation (low conc.) is the variability as CV across all independent experiments (n>390) after normalization based on the response of the lowest test concentration. It is assumed that the lowest test concentration does not affect any of the endpoints measured. Inter-experimental variation (positive controls) is the variability of the positive control across all independent experiments (n>360) after normalization. For further detail, see Fig. 7. Positive control: proliferation media without growth factors (EGF, FGF) Table 1 summarizes the assay performance in terms of variability of each endpoint in the assay. This variability spans different individuals where cells were derived from. Table 1: Assay variability quantified as CV. Inter-experimental variation (positive controls) is only given for specific endpoints. Sensitivity and specificity of the NPC1 assay are determined based on a set of 9 predicted human DNT positive compounds and 17 predicted human DNT negative compounds (Masjosthusmann et al., 2020; Blum et al., 2023). Based on this compound set the following performance parameters are obtained for the NPC1 assay. Specificity: 100 % Sensitivity: 33% Here, it is important to mention, that it is not expected that the NPC1 assay identifies all DNT positive compounds as not all of those compounds act via an effect on cell proliferation on the developing brain. For most compounds the exact MoA for their neurodevelopmental adversity is not precisely known, yet other mechanisms like neuron/glia differentiation, neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis and neuronal network formation are amongst the known DNT MoAs. It is therefore recommended that this assay is run as one part of an in vitro DNT battery.

Proliferation medium without growth factors (w/o GF) serves as a positive control for NPC1a (proliferation by area) and NPC1b (proliferation by BrdU).
