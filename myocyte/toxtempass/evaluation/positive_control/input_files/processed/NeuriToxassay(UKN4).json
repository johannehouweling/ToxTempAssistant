(8.1) Which test system and readout(s) are used? (4.1; 5.2) Which biological process(es) (e.g. neurite outgrowth, differentiation) and/or toxicological events (e.g. oxidative stress, cell death) are modelled/reflected by your test method? (8.1) To which (human) adverse outcome(s) is your test method related or could be related? (8.1; 9.2; 9.3) Which hazard(s) do(es) your test method (potentially) predict?

          "answer": "This in vitro test method is based on human neurons (LUHMES cells) at a stage of neurite growth. Is assesses (a) disturbances in the development of the nervous system/brain structures, and (b) direct damage to the adult nervous system, by exposure to toxicants. The neurite area (which serves as indirect measurement of neuronal interconnectivity) of stained differentiating neurons as well as cellular viability are measured simultaneously using high content imaging. The processes of neurite outgrowth and cell viability are assessed. The data of this method are meant to predict (a) developmental disorders in children caused by compound exposure during fetal development, and (b) damage to the developing nervous system, in particular to dopaminergic parts of the nervous system. The method has not undergone formal validation and has not been part of a ring trial. It predicts some aspects of neurotoxicity, but not all aspects covered by an in vivo neurotoxicity study (TG424). It has been used in the screening of medium-sized compound libraries, has undergone some mechanistic evaluation, and has been linked to AOP:3 in aopwiki.org (parkinsonian motor deficits). According to the readiness criteria as published by Bal-Price et al. (2018) the NeuriTox assay obtained the readiness score A.",

          "answer": "Quantification of neurite outgrowth An automated microplate reading microscope (Array-ScanII HCS Reader, Cellomics, PA) equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera (resolution 1024 x 1024; run at 2 x 2 binning) was used for image acquisition. Ten fields per well were imaged. Images were recorded in 2 channels using a 20x objective and excitation/emission wavelengths of 365 ± 50/535 ± 45 to detect H-33342 in channel 1 and 474 ± 40/535 ± 45 to detect calcein in channel 2. In both channels, a fixed exposure time and an intensity histogram-derived threshold were used for object identification. Neurite pixels were identified using the following image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified as objects in channel 1 according to their size, area, shape, and intensity which were predefined on untreated cells using a machine-based learning algorithm, and manual selection of nuclei to be classified as intact. The nuclear outlines were expanded by 3.2 µm in each direction, to define a virtual cell soma area (VCSA) based on the following procedure: The average width of the cytoplasm ring (distance nucleus - cell membrane) of LUHMES cells was experimentally determined to be 2.3 µm. Size irregularities were not always due to growing neurites, as determined by combined F-actin/tubulin beta-III staining. To avoid scoring of false positive neurite areas, the exclusion ring (VCSA) was made bigger than the average cell size. Then, we used two control compounds (U0126 and bisindolylmaleimid I) to vary the expanded outlines from 0.6 to 4 µm. We found 3.2 µm to be optimal both to detect neurite growth over time and to identify reduced neurite growth with high sensitivity. All calcein-positive pixels of the field (beyond a given intensity threshold) were defined as viable cellular structures (VCSs). The threshold was dynamically determined for each field after flat field and background correction and intensity normalization to 512 gray values and was set to 12% of the maximal brightness (channel 63 of 512). The VCS defines the sum of all somata and neurites without their assignment to individual cells. In an automatic calculation, the VCSAs, defined in the H- 33342 channel, were used as filter in the calcein channel and subtracted from the VCS. The remaining pixels (VCS - VCSA) in the calcein channel were defined as neurite area. Quantification of individual viable cells by imaging For a quantitative assessment of viable cells, the same images used to assess neurite area were analysed using another image analysis algorithm: nuclei were identified in channel 1 as objects according to their size, area, shape, and intensity. Nuclei of apoptotic cells with increased fluorescence were excluded. A VCSA was defined around each nucleus by expanding it by 0.3 µm into each direction. Calcein-AM staining, labelling live cells, was detected in channel 2. The algorithm quantified the calcein intensity in the VCSA areas. Cells having an average calcein signal intensity in the VCSAs below a predefined threshold were classified by the program as “not viable”. Valid nuclei with a positive calcein signal in their cognate VCSA were counted as viable cells. A positive calcein signal was based on measurements of the average intensity (normal cells: 1300 ± 115, threshold: < 50) and the total integrated intensity (normal cells: 186,000 ± 23,600, threshold < 1000) of cells.",

A first screen application has been the NTP80 screen (80 compounds provided by the US NTP). Data are published Delp et al. 2018. A second screen application has been the cross systems case study of the EU-ToxRisk project. The baseline variation is indicated in Krebs et al., 2020. Moreover, an overview is given for 19 compounds on the BMC/BMCL ratio as measure of readout certainty. A third screen was performed in the context of the EFSA DNT test battery evaluation with 120 compounds (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). From this screen the following performance indicators were obtained: A: Sensitivity: 100%  With NeuriTox as standalone assay in 17 `tool negatives´ tested (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). B: Specificity: 82.7%  With NeuriTox combined in a full DNT battery and a selected set of 27 positive compounds with evidence for DNT (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). C: Baseline variation (intra-experimental) Neurite outgrowth: 11.7 ± 4.5% Cell viability: 3.8 ± 3.5% D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) Neurite outgrowth: 15.3% Cell viability: 4.3% E: Variation of a positive control run on each (inter-experimental) Neurite outgrowth: 38.5% Definition of values C-E C: Baseline variation (intra-experimental) is the mean CV±SD of the CV of all replicates of the solvent control from each experiment across n>200 experiments. D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) is the variability across all independent experiments (n>200) after normalization based on the response of the lowest test concentration. It was assumed that the lowest test concentration does not affect any of the endpoints measured. E: Variation of a positive control run on each (inter-experimental) is the variability of the positive control across all independent experiments (n>40) after normalization. Example for a positive control that on average reduced the specific endpoint down to 40% (relative to solvent control) and a calculated variability of 50%: 0.5 x 40% = +/- 20%  The positive control with mean of 40% varies from 20% to 60%.",

          "question": "List elements of the test method (e.g. consumables, chemicals, analytical methods, equipment) that are protected by patents or any other means. Indicate the type of protection and where the element (or license for it) may be obtained.",
          "answer": "To our best knowledge, no elements needed to conduct the experimental part of the test method are protected. Programs used to conduct the analysis of the data (Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism) need to be purchased or obtained by license agreement, however data analysis and plotting can be done with other, freely available tools.",
          "answer_quality_score": "Medium",
          "answer_quality_justification": "The answer partially addresses the question by stating that no elements of the test method are protected, but it lacks clarity and completeness. It mentions software that requires a license but does not specify the type of protection or where licenses can be obtained. It also does not address consumables, chemicals, analytical methods, or equipment in detail."
