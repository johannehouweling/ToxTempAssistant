(8.1) Which test system and readout(s) are used? (4.1; 5.2) Which biological process(es) (e.g. neurite outgrowth, differentiation) and/or toxicological events (e.g. oxidative stress, cell death) are modelled/reflected by your test method? (8.1) To which (human) adverse outcome(s) is your test method related or could be related? (8.1; 9.2; 9.3) Which hazard(s) do(es) your test method (potentially) predict? (8.1; 8.6) Does the test method capture an endpoint of current regulatory studies? (9.5) If the method has undergone some form of validation/evaluation, give its status. (9.4)",
          "answer": "This in vitro test method uses human neural crest cells (NCCs) generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). It assesses disturbances of NCC migration during fetal development. The number of migrated NCCs, as well as cell viability are measured simultaneously using high content imaging. Thereby the processes of cell migration and cell death are measured in cells exposed to potential toxicants for 24 h. The data of this method are meant to predict developmental disorders and malformations e.g., neural tube defects or craniofacial malformations caused by compound exposure during fetal development. The method has a well- established prediction model, but it has not undergone formal validation and it has not been part of a ring trial. It has been used in the screening of several medium-sized compound libraries. According to the readiness criteria as published by Bal-Price et al. (2018) the neural crest cell migration assay obtained the readiness score A- .",

          "answer": "A highly homogeneous pre-differentiated population of neural crest cells is added to coated wells. In the middle of the well is a silicone stopper that prevents cells from settling in a circular area in the middle of the well. The cells are kept viable and alive by the presence of EGF and FGF in the medium, and they become adherent overnight. When the stopper is removed, the cells form a dense monolayer in the culture dish, with a sharply demarcated circular area in the middle that is free of cells. Due to their natural spontaneous migration behaviour, the cells move into the cell-free area. The cells are still in a proliferative state. Proliferation at the edge of the cell free area contributes to a small extent to “apparent migration behaviour”. This has been characterized and quantified in detail (Nyffeler et al. 2016).

Migration inhibition of NCCs after treatment with toxicants is measured relative to control conditions (solvent control cells). For the quantification the cells are stained with calcein-AM and H-33342 for 30 min at 37 °C. The center of the well (migration zone) is imaged in four tiles with a 5x objective. Afterwards the four images are stitched together to obtain one image. For migration quantification, a software tool has been developed (http://invitrotox.uni-konstanz.de/).

The variation between the plates of one experiment is lower than 5% and the variation between different experiments is lower than 20%. The results were always normalized to untreated controls. • Operators can get trained within 2-4 weeks. Cell seeding and medium change should be performed as fast as possible to keep cells as short as possible at room temperature. The more practice an operator has, the faster the critical steps can be performed. • Substances are added when pipette tips are touching the wall of the wells right above the medium surface.

          "answer": "Some background on the test performance is given in chapters 8.2/8.3 (prediction model). Several performance parameters for the test were obtained in several separate evaluation rounds. A first evaluation was done during the first publication of the model and its applications (Nyffeler et al. 2016). Here, a panel of well-selected positive and negative controls have been tested. Accordingly, the specificity was 100% and the sensitivity was > 90 %. In dedicated experiments, S/N ratios of > 20 and a z’ of > 0.5 have been determined. The compound used as positive control cytochalasin D was run across 35 different assay plates. The migration percentage relative to the solvent control varied between 30 and 70% across all plates (Nyffeler et al. 2016, Supplementary S2). Later, the test has been used in screening campaigns, and real-live performance data under broader screen conditions have been obtained. The different performance data need to be considered, when a compound is a hit in a screen, or whether it has been specifically evaluated in a hit follow-up or a mechanistic project. A first screen application has been the NTP80 screen (80 compounds provided by the US NTP). Data are published in Nyffeler et al. 2017. A second screen application has been the cross systems case study of the EU-ToxRisk project. The baseline variation is indicated in Krebs et al., 2020. Moreover, an overview is given for 19 compounds on the BMC/BMCL ratio as measure of readout certainty. A third screen was performed in the context of the EFSA DNT test battery evaluation with 120 compounds (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). From this screen the following performance indicators were obtained: A: Specificity of DNT IVB: 100% → Also with cMINC as standalone assay in 17 `tool negatives´ tested (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). B: Sensitivity of DNT IVB: 82.7% → With cMINC combined in a full DNT battery and a selected set of 27 positive compounds with evidence for DNT (Masjosthusmann et al. 2020). C: Baseline variation (intra-experimental) Migration: 14.8 ± 4.3% Cell viability: 6 ± 3% D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) Migration: 15.6% Cell viability: 9.7% E: Variation of a positive control run on each (inter-experimental) Migration: 32.2% Definition of values C-E C: Baseline variation (intra-experimental) is the mean coefficient of variation CV±SD of the CV of all replicates of the solvent control from each experiment across n>200 experiments. D: Baseline variation (inter-experimental) is the variability across all independent experiments (n>200) after normalization based on the response of the lowest test concentration. It was assumed that the lowest test concentration does not affect any of the endpoints measured. E: Variation of a positive control run on each (inter-experimental) is the variability of the positive control across all independent experiments (n>40) after normalization. Example for a positive control that on average reduced the specific endpoint down to 40% (relative to solvent control) and a calculated variability of 50%: 0.5 x 40% = +/- 20% → The positive control with mean of 40% varies from 20% to 60%.",

          "answer_quality_justification": "The answer partially addresses the question by providing information on lipid content and albumin concentration, which are relevant parameters for determining free compound concentrations. However, it lacks details on the protein content of the medium and cells, the volume of the cells, and the volume and surface area of the culture dish. It mentions a PBPK modeling strategy related to IVIVE but does not provide comprehensive information on IVIVE strategies or previous use of the test for IVIVE.

The orthogonal transwell-assay is also of lower throughput. c) The assay has been considered as part of the ESNATS (Embryonic Stem cell-based Novel Alternative Testing Strategies) screen battery. d) The test can to some extent be stand-alone (positive hits are meaningful).
