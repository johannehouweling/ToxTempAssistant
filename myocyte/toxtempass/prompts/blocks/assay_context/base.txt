Assay context (for framing only):

Assay name: {{assay_name}}
Assay purpose: {{assay_purpose}}
Biological system: {{biological_system}}
Experimental format: {{format}}
Regulatory context: {{regulatory_context}}

Framing rules:
- Treat this assay strictly as described above.
- Do NOT assume the assay follows an OECD Test Guideline unless explicitly stated.
- Do NOT assume standard endpoints, controls, or validation criteria unless explicitly stated.
- Do NOT generalize from similar assays or common practice.
- The assay context limits interpretation; it does not add missing information.
