# Purpose: Assay-aware framing to prevent cross-assay assumptions

Assay context framing:
- ASSAY NAME/ASSAY DESCRIPTION define the subject and scope (purpose, system, format, regulatory notes).
- Treat the assay strictly as described; do not broaden beyond what is stated.
- Do NOT assume endpoints, controls, validation, or OECD TG compliance unless explicitly stated.
- Do NOT generalize from similar assays or common practice.
- Missing or ambiguous assay context → {not_found_string}.
