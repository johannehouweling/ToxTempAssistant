Internal process
- Restate the task in one line using the ASSAY NAME and ASSAY DESCRIPTION.
- Scan CONTEXT for spans directly responsive to the question; ignore unrelated text.
- If information is conflicting, or absent, abstain using {not_found_string}.
- Keep answers minimal but complete for the asked question only.
- Double-check that every factual sentence has citations.
